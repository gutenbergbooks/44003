<h2 class="vspace">Hearings Before the President's Commission<br />

on the<br />

Assassination of President Kennedy</h2>

<h2 id="rhp"><span class="smaller"><a name="Thursday_March_19_1964_Afternoon_Session" id="Thursday_March_19_1964_Afternoon_Session"><i>Thursday, March 19, 1964&mdash;Afternoon Session</i></a></span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2:05 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May we proceed, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes; we are all ready whenever you are. You are still under
affirmation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was at the point of describing the driver's license application,
but before I do that, Mrs. Paine, may I hand you the document again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It has been marked Commission Exhibit 426. You were making
a comparison with the block printing on that document with like block printing
that you testified yesterday had been written in your address book. I have forgotten
the exhibit number, but in your address book which you have before
<span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the printing in your address book to which you were addressing
yourself was what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His printing of the place where he worked in April of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were comparing that printing which you saw him put in
your address book with what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The printing on this application for Texas driver's license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And any particular printing on that application?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Was put in in pen. I do observe that the printing here uses a
mixture of upper case and lower case letters, as does the printing in my phone
book, most of it being block upper case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The form and shape of the printing in both of the documents <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is similar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Similar. All right, thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, because of the point raised by Representative Ford with
particular reference to the word "photographer" which, by the way, is misspelled,
it is spelled "f-o-t-o-g-r-a-p-e-r," and things of that sort do occur as
you have already noted in many of his writings, very bad misspellings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes, his grammar seems to be better than this spelling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. This form is an official form printed of the Texas State
License Bureau entitled "Application for Texas driver's license," on the line
provided for "name" there appears over "first name", "Lee"; over "middle
name", "Harvey"; and "last name", "Oswald."</p>

<p>The second set of spaces, provisions for address, birth, and occupation. He
gives as his address, 2545 West Fifth Street, Irving, Tex. Was that the address
of their home when you first became acquainted with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the address 2545 Irving Street familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it is 2515.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Perhaps we will have to have it interpreted by someone else.
It looks like a "4" to me, but it may be a "1." This birthday, October 18,
1939. The age last birthday 24, and then under "occupation" appears the word
I have already related. Sex, male; color of eyes, gray; weight, 146 pounds;
race the letter "C"; color of hair, brown; height, 5 foot 9 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Were you about to comment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was interested in his comment on his race.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I assume C means Caucasian. There are a series of questions,
printed questions on the form, and he answered them, they are from 1 to 12,
as follows:</p>

<p>"Question No. 1" he answers in the negative, "Have you ever held a Texas
license?"</p>

<p>Question No. 2. All these are in the negative.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been examined for a Texas license?</p>

<p>"Have you ever held a license in any other State?</p>

<p>"Have you ever been denied a license?</p>

<p>"Has your license and driving privilege ever been suspended, revoked, or
canceled?</p>

<p>"Have you ever been convicted of driving while intoxicated, failure to stop
and render aid, aggravated assault with a motor vehicle, negligent homicide
with a motor vehicle or murder with a motor vehicle?"</p>

<p>All answered in the negative.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been convicted of any other moving traffic violation?</p>

<p>"Have you ever been involved as a driver in a motor vehicle accident?</p>

<p>"Have you ever been subject to losses of consciousness or muscular control?</p>

<p>"Have you ever been addicted to the use of intoxicating liquor or narcotic
drugs?</p>

<p>"Do you have any physical or mental defects?"</p>

<p>And, lastly: "Have you ever been a patient in a hospital for mental illness?"</p>

<p>The side as to the driving record, that is the reverse side, nothing appears
thereon, and nothing in any portion of the form which deals with the record of
his examination.</p>

<p>I am a little at a loss, Mr. Chairman, as to whether I should offer this in
evidence at the present moment, because it is a document found among his
effects in his room, and my statement of fact would be pure hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. How did we get in possession of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was supplied to us by the FBI.</p>

<p>The document was turned over to the FBI. May I withhold offering the document
in evidence? We may have another witness who will be able to qualify it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Who can identify it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am sure we will have a witness. We do want the document in
evidence. [Commission Exhibit No. 426 is also Commission Exhibit No. 112,
vol. I, p. 113.]</p>

<p>Identifying as Commission Exhibit 427 a form of employee identification questionnaire
of the Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall Co. Please examine Exhibit 427. I
direct your attention to the signature in the lower left-hand corner. Are you
familiar with that signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't say I am familiar with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any discussion with Lee Oswald relating to
his obtaining of a position with Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when did that discussion occur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In New Orleans on the second trip, the end of September, when
we talked about the possibility of Marina's coming back to have the baby in
Texas where they could qualify as one year residents, he equipped me to show
that he had been in Texas, and in Dallas for a year by giving me a receipt or
part of a paycheck, I don't know just what it was, with the Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall
name on it, in October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the <span class="locked">purpose&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was supplying me with documents that would admit her
to Parkland Hospital as a patient. He gave me <span class="locked">his&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To show the <span class="locked">necessary&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That he had worked with Stovall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the necessary residential period of time in Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And the necessary residence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Did you take that document with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did you do with it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Took it to Parkland Hospital. And subsequently returned it to
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For what purpose had you gone to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For prenatal care and care at the time of the birth of Marina
Oswald's second child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is Parkland Hospital a public institution in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With the necessary residential period of time, Marina, if she
had qualified in that respect, or did qualify then she could receive treatment
with respect to the birth of her child either at no cost to her or at reduced cost,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I understood it to be cost fitted to their ability to pay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And so you did, yourself, affirmatively arrange that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. What arrangement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Affirmatively. You did it yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have now reached the summer period of 1963, and covered
some of it in part. My recollection of your testimony is that you vacationed in
the summer of 1963.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You visited various members of your family up north?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You departed Irving, Tex., some time in July, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe it was the 27th of July.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And just tell us whom of your family you visited and where you
visited, without telling us what you did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I visited my mother-in-law and stepfather-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Mr. and Mrs. Young, Arthur Young?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Paoli, Pa.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I first went to Naushon Island off the coast of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you driving in the station wagon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With your children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you went from there to where? Whom did you visit next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. How detailed do you want to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just tell us whom you visited is all.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I stopped and saw Miss Mary Forman, in Connecticut, one night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She is an old friend of yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She is an old friend of mine from Columbus, Ohio, and went on
then to Paoli the next day, and stayed there, again with the Youngs, until the
early part of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Is that Paoli, Pa.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you visit your mother and your father or either of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My father came to Paoli and visited me there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did I ask you yesterday, Mrs. Paine, and please forgive me if
this is a repetition, the occupation of your father.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He is an insurance underwriter; he composes the fine print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he at one time an actuary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What does actuary mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A man who computes the probabilities and works in connection
<span class="locked">with&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He may be. I am not certain exactly what his position is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For what company, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The Nationwide Insurance Company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is their main office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In Columbus, Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your father visited you at Paoli. Did you see your mother during
that summer period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did. I saw her briefly on the way to Naushon Island,
and then again I saw her on my way back to the south and west, in Columbus,
Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At Columbus, she was living there then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see your sister on that trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did you see her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She lives in suburban Washington, and I saw here there at her
home. I also saw Michael's brother, and his wife, who live in Baltimore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify Michael's brother, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His name is Cameron Paine, C-a-m-e-r-o-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his occupation or business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He works with Social Security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the State or the United States Government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For the United States Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That covers generally the people you visited that summer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I also visited my brother, in Yellow Springs, Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your brother, the physician?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. I visited with friends in the Philadelphia area,
while I was at Paoli.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you mean by the term "friends" there to mean in the sense
I would mean friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or members of the Friends Society?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Some were both, but I meant it as personal friends. And then
I saw also friends, also both, capital F and small, in Richmond, Ind., and then
from there I headed directly south to New Orleans.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Shall I go on to arrival at New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This spanned a period of a little over 2 months, did it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was just short of 2 months total that I was away from my
home in Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in the meantime you had had the correspondence with Marina
that you had related this morning, during the course of your going along,
had you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. During that vacation she and I exchanged one letter each.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Had you advised her that you were coming to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For what purpose?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To visit. And to talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To see if it was appropriate for her to come to my house for
the birth of the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that moment, at that time, when you were about to return
or about to go to New Orleans, this concept was limited to her coming to be
with you for the birth of the child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least temporarily she abandoned the notion of joining you
on a semipermanent basis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was abandoned. It was not taken up again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You arrived in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The 20th of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Maybe you are going to get to this. Maybe I am anticipating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
your case, so to speak, but during these visits that you paid to your friends on
this trip, did you talk about your association with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Quite a lot. It was rather an important thing to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have some questions to put to Mrs. Paine on that subject,
but they are in the area of the collateral that I spoke of this morning, so I did
not go into them at the moment.</p>

<p>Now, starting with your arrival in New Orleans, you got there in the morning
or afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I arrived midafternoon, as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you went directly to their home, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you find when you reached the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was expected. They had groceries bought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina and Lee, and the baby June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't have a calendar before me. The 20th of September is
what day of the week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is a Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I spent the night there that night and the succeeding 2 nights.
Lee who bought the groceries while I was there, was host. At one point Mrs.
Ruth Kloepfer, who has been previously mentioned, came and visited with her
sister&mdash;excuse me, with her two daughters. This was after I had made a telephone
call to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These daughters were adults or were they children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The daughters were grown daughters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Grown?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In college, college-age daughters, and one had been studying
Russian, didn't know very much. I was impressed with the role that Lee took
of the general host, talking with them, looking over some slides that one of the
daughters had brought of her trip, recent trip to Russia, showing sights that they
recognized, I guess, in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That the girls recognized?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that Lee and Marina recognized of Moscow, or Lee did, at
least. And he was very outgoing and warm and friendly. He seemed in good
spirits that weekend. I found him&mdash;he made a much better impression on me,
I will say, that weekend than the last weekend I had seen him, which was in May.</p>

<p>I could see, and it was the first time that I felt that he was concerned about
his wife's physical welfare and about where she could go to have the baby, and
he seemed distinctly relieved to consider the possibility of her going to Dallas
County and getting care through Parkland Hospital, and clearly pleased that I
wanted to offer this, and pleased to have her go, which relieved my mind a good
deal.</p>

<p>I hadn't wanted to have such an arrangement come about without his being
interested in having it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the course of this, did you say you were there 3 days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Three nights, two days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Two days and three nights; there was then a discussion between
yourself and Marina, yourself on the one hand, Marina and Lee on the other,
in which it was determined that Marina would return with you to Irving, Tex.,
for the purpose of having the birth of her child in Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee did participate in those discussions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, during the course of the time you were there, was there any
discussion of the fact that Lee was at that time jobless and would be seeking a
position?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I knew from Marina's letters that he was out of work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We did have one short conversation and this was in English. I
began it. He was willing to proceed in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is one of the few occasions in which he permitted himself
to speak with you in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. I asked him if he thought his application was
any impediment to his getting and keeping a job. He said he didn't know, and
went on to say that he had already lost his job when he was arrested for passing
out pro-Cuba literature here in New Orleans. And he said he spent the
night in jail, and I said, "Did Marina know that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she knew it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want you to finish the conversation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was as much of a revelation, accurate revelation of what
he had done as I ever got from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine. I am going to get into that with you.</p>

<p>I would like to have you finish the conversation first before you give your
reaction.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was the end of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the end?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, with respect to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee activity,
had you up to this moment heard of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities, if any, of
any character and to any extent, with respect to the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had not heard of any such activities.</p>

<p>The name of the committee was not mentioned. I did not know the name of
the committee until it appeared in the newspapers after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, how did Lee Harvey Oswald describe that? What did he
say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said that he was passing out pro-Castro or pro-Cuba literature,
and that there were some anti-Castro people who also caused some disturbance,
and that he had spent the night in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did I understand you correctly to say that he assigned that
as a <span class="locked">possible&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, on the contrary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As possibly having had some effect on his loss of position?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the contrary, he made the point that he had already lost his
job before this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he had lost his position before the Fair Play for Cuba
incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So that he did not know, he could not cite an instance where his
application had made it difficult for him in his work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had conversation with Marina prior to this time in
which she might have suggested or did suggest that his application and his
history of having gone to Russia and then returned to the United States as
having an adverse effect on his efforts to obtain employment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; nothing of that nature was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was never discussed in your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it ever discussed in your presence or raised in your presence
by anybody other than Lee Harvey Oswald or Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it ever discussed with you by anybody even though they
weren't present? By "they" I mean Lee and Marina. You recall none? This
is the first instance of any discussion of that character, and you raised it, did
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have exhausted your recollection of this particular conversation,
have you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I gather from your testimony that you found the relations between
Marina and Lee improved on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They certainly appeared to be improved. The weekend time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
was certainly much more comfortable than the weekend in early May had
been when I first was in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You described yesterday an irritability as between Marina and
Lee when you were there in the spring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that that had continued during all the time you were in
New Orleans. You found the situation different?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On your return in the fall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have already related the incident about touring Bourbon
Street, and that occurred on this occasion, did it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. During that weekend, yes; those days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee Harvey Oswald stayed home that evening or that
day. It was late in the day, was it, rather than the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was early evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Early evening. What did he do at home, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When we got back Marina noticed that the dishes had been
cleaned up and put away. I take it back, they had been washed, not put away.
And I believe he did some packing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In anticipation of your returning to Irving, Tex., with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>I was impressed during these 2 days with his willingness to help with the
packing. He did virtually all the packing and all the loading of the things into
the car. I simply thought that gentlemanly of him at the time. I have
wondered since whether he wasn't doing it by preference to having me handle
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was about to ask you your impression in that direction. Did
he seem eager to do the packing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did, distinctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Distinctly eager?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall he began as early, you see, as Saturday night and we
left Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are aware of the fact he did some packing while you
and Marina were on tour?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It couldn't have been Saturday night, because I only arrived on
Saturday. More likely it was Sunday. Is Bourbon Street open on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bourbon Street is open all the time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Then it would have to <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have the feeling at the time that he was quite eager
to do the packing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you have the feeling it was just a touch out of the
ordinary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It didn't occur to me that it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But on reflection now, you think it was out of the ordinary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On reflection now I think it wasn't simply a gesture of the
gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But at the time it didn't arouse enough interest on your part
to have a question in your mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I would have expected it of other men, but this was the
first I saw him taking that much interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It did arrest your attention on that score, in any event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you were there for 2 full days and 3 evenings. Would
you tell us, conserving your description in your words, what did you do during
these 2 days and 3 nights. When I say "you", I am including all three of
you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of course, afternoons we usually spent in rest for the children,
having all small children, all of us having small children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whenever this doesn't include Lee Harvey Oswald would you
be good enough to tell us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When he was not present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection is that he was present most of the weekend.
He went out to buy groceries, came in with a cheery call to his two girls, saying,
"Yabutchski," which means girls, the Russian word for girls, as he came in the
door. It was more like Harvey than I had seen him before. He remembered
this time. I saw him reading a pocketbook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Commission is interested in his readings. To the best of
your ability to recall, tell us. You noticed it now, of course.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I don't recall the title of it. I do recall that I loaned him
a pocketbook at one point. I can't even recall what it was about. But I might
if I saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it a book on any political subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it an English book?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But it was in English, unless it was a parallel text of Russian-English
short stories, something like that, I can't remember. It might have been
Reid's Ten Days That Shook the World, or something like that, but I am not at
all certain. I would have thought he would have read that, anyway.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it a book that you recall having had with you that
summer? Ten <span class="locked">Days&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a book I should still own, and I don't recall for sure
whether I have that one.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Ten Days That Shook the World?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am very shaky in my memory. I had prepared a collection
of books for the course in Russian at Saint Marks School, and they included
history and literature and English.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But you were still anticipating teaching Russian at
Saint Marks School in Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right, and this was just part of a bibliography of things
of interest that included some of the more historical texts from many points
of view regarding Soviet life.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I interrupted you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was asking you to tell us in general what was done during
those 2 days and 3 nights.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We went out to wash diapers at the local washiteria, and stayed
while they were done and went back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think that he went. My recollection is that Marina and
I went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He remained home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you visit with any of their in-laws?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they visit while you were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they come there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I have already referred to a visit from Mrs. Kloepfer, with
her two girls which must have been the day before we left or Monday.</p>

<p>No, Sunday, it must have been Sunday. It wasn't much time altogether, because
Sunday was the day before we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Mrs. Kloepfer a native American?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no idea. She speaks natively.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But she does have a command of the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no, no. Her daughter has had 1 year of Russian in college,
and was much too shy to begin to say anything, thoroughly overwhelmed by
meeting someone who really spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I must have misinterpreted your testimony this morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Her daughter had visited in the Soviet Union just recently and
had slides that she had taken that summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But Mrs. Kloepfer, as far as you are informed, had no command
of the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely none. She was the only person I knew to try to contact
to ask if she knew or could find anyone in New Orleans who knew Russian,
and she said she didn't know anyone, over the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I, therefore, also tried to get Mrs. Blanchard to seek out
someone who could talk to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Blanchard had no command of the Russian language, as
far as you knew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would be certain she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you described for us generally the course of events in the
2 days and 3 nights you were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, much of the last portion, some of the last portion of Sunday
was spent packing up. It was a very well loaded automobile by then, because
I already had a great many of my own, including a boat on the top of the car
to which we attached the playpen, stroller, and other things on top. I should
describe in detail the packing, which was another thing that made me feel that
he did care for his wife.</p>

<p>We left on Monday morning, yes, Monday morning early, the 23d, and it
seemed to me he was very sorry to see her go. They kissed goodbye and we
got in the car and I started down intending really to go no farther than the first
gas station because I had a soft rear tire and I wasn't going to have a flat with
this great pile of goods on top of not only my car but my spare, so I went down
to the first gas station that was open a couple blocks down, and prepared to
buy a tire.</p>

<p>Lee having watched us, walked down to the gas station and talked and visited
while I arranged to have the tire changed, bought a new one and had it changed.
I felt he wished or thought he should be offering something toward the cost of
the tire. He said, "That sure is going to cost a lot, isn't it?" And I said,
"Yes; but car owners have to expect that." This is as close as he came to
offering financial help. But it was at least a gesture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then there was no financial help given you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no financial help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Given you by Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In connection with the return of Marina to Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And he did not at this time give her, so far as I know, any small
change or petty cash to take with her, whereas when he left her in late April
to go to my house, she to go to my house, and he to go to New Orleans, he left
$10 or so with her. She spent that on incidentals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, did he ever, during all of the period of your acquaintance
with the Oswalds, ever offer any reimbursement financially or anything
at all to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he never offered anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion between you and him on the subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. As close as we came to such discussion was saying that
when they had enough money and perhaps after Christmas they would get an
apartment again, and I judged, felt that he was saving money towards renting
a furnished apartment for his family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I used the term "offer." Did he ever offer? Did he in fact
ever give you any money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He in fact never gave me any money, either. He did give Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The one incident of which you are speaking or on other occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was that one incident in April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did give her, I think, $10, just prior, or some time close to the
time of the assassination, because she planned to buy some shoes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Shoes for herself, or her children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For herself, flats. But when he gave that to her I am not certain.
I do know that we definitely planned to go out on Friday afternoon, the 22d of
November, to buy those shoes. We did not go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is you girls planned to do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She and I did; yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Jenner, do you plan to ask questions about the
process of packing of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I do. Now, this improvement in the attitude of Lee Harvey
Oswald, arrested your deliberate attention&mdash;didn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it did. It was really the first I had felt any sympathy
for him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any feeling that he, in turn, felt that he might not
be seeing Marina any more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no feeling of that whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He told me that he was going to try to look for work in Houston,
and possibly in Philadelphia; these were the two names he mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are interested in that, in this particular phase of the investigation.
Did he make that statement in your presence, in the presence of Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it that this was elicited by a discussion of the subject
of his going to look for work after you girls had left, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. About what he would do after we left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you repeat just what he said on that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He told me that he was going to go to Houston to look for work,
or possibly to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about having any acquaintances or friends
in either of those towns?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did. You recalled to my mind he said he had a friend in
Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he mention other towns he might undertake to visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he didn't. Or any other friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any inference or did you infer from anything he said
or which might have been said in your presence that after you girls left he
intended to leave New Orleans? To <span class="locked">look&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was definitely planning to leave New Orleans after we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Promptly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had that definite impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he put it in terms of leaving New Orleans to go to Houston,
or what was the other town?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Possibly Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Possibly Philadelphia. Now, during all that weekend, was there
any discussion of anybody going to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the subject of Mexico discussed at any time and in any
respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not at any time nor any respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the trip back to Irving, Tex., did Marina say anything on
the subject of Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you girls discuss what Lee was going to do during this
interim period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Only to the extent that he was looking for a job, but I think that
discussion, my memory of it comes from a discussion with Lee rather than a
discussion with her. I may say that we never talked about any particular
time, he would see Marina again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He kissed her a very fond goodbye, both at home and then again
at the gas station, and I felt he cared and he would certainly see her. And this
I recalled the other night. It should be put in here. As he was giving me this
material, I have already mentioned, that indicated his claim to 1 year residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
in Texas, I can't remember just what I said that elicited it from him, but some
reference to, shall I say that you have gone, or how can I&mdash;what shall I say
about the husband, where is the husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do the best in your own words.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Shall I say that you have gone away or away looking for work
or something? What shall I say about you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is in English now, this one English conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Apropos of being prepared to admit her to Parkland. I asked,
what shall I say about him, that he is gone or what?</p>

<p>He said, "Oh, no, that might appear that I had abandoned her."</p>

<p>And I was glad to hear him say that he didn't at all want it to appear or to
feel of himself that he had abandoned her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything as to what representations you might make
to Parkland Hospital and other State authorities in that respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the trip back to&mdash;may I defer the packing until Representative
Ford returns&mdash;on the trip back to Irving, Tex., did you and Marina discuss
the subject matter of Dee's going to Houston, Tex., or to Philadelphia to look
for a job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; we didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time during the weekend you were in New Orleans or
driving from New Orleans to Irving, Tex., was the friend identified, the supposed
friend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Houston, identified?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I remember wondering if there was one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wondered at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wondered to myself if there was one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What made you wonder?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I may say, also, I wondered, as I have already indicated for the
Commission, I had wondered, from time to time, whether this was a man who
was working as a spy or in any way a threat to the Nation, and I thought, "This
is the first I have heard anything about a contact. I am interested to know if
this is a real thing or something unreal." And waited to see really whether I
would learn any more about it. But this thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It did? Now, many of my questions are directed towards trying
to find out what this man did with his time. When he went job hunting, according
to some of the records here, he appeared to return home rather promptly.
That is, he would leave in the morning but he would be home before noontime.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you notice anything of that nature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never saw him when he was job hunting. The times in New
Orleans, of course, I wasn't there. The times in April he was job hunting from
a base of 214 Neely Street, and in October he was operating from the base of
the room on Beckley Street. So I never saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that as far as&mdash;this I would like to bring out, Mr. Chairman&mdash;as
far as your contact with Lee Harvey Oswald as such, Mrs. Paine, your opportunities
for knowing what he did with his time were limited, were they not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They were limited.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is in the spring, there was this New Orleans period when
he was absent in New Orleans altogether during the 2 weeks that Marina was
with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is the period preceding the trip to New Orleans that they lived
a little distance from you, and that was in a period of your really becoming more
acquainted with them. Were you aware of what Mr. Oswald was doing during
the daytime, or evening along in that period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the fall when you saw him then for 2 days and 3 nights in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the early fall of 1963, he was out of work. He was at the home substantially
all of that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You returned to Irving, then, and you didn't see him until he
appeared as you testified this morning, on October 4, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, he was in your home from October 4, 1963, until what
was it&mdash;the 15th of October? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not at all. He was in the home for the weekend of October 4.
I then took him to the bus around noon on the 7th, that is a Monday, to the
Intercity Bus between Irving and Dallas. You can't walk to it from my house.
There is no way to get anywhere from my house unless you use a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are interested in that, also, Mrs. Paine, about his ability to
get to your home from whatever means of public transportation there was.
Would you be good enough to describe the problems in that connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He called on the afternoon of the 4th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give us the problems first, the physical problems?
Where was the bus located? What was the bus terminal? How far was it
from your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The bus terminal in Irving where you could get a bus going to
Dallas was several miles away, 2 to 3 miles away from my home, a 10 minute
car ride.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what means of transportation was there from the bus
terminal to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any public transportation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was nothing public.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You would have to hitchhike or walk or be driven?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, there were occasions when you would have to
go and pick him up at the bus terminal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall at least one such occasion, and that was on the 12th
of October, a Saturday, which was the next time he came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the next time following the October 4 weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was the first time that you heard, or had any notice of the
fact that this man had been in Mexico, or possibly may have been in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They are two different questions. I will answer the first one.
I heard that he had been in Mexico after the assassination in one of the papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that the first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that was the first time. Looking back then, with that
knowledge, I could see that I might have guessed this from two other things
that had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, give us them in sequence, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. One was, I can describe by an incident that took place at our
home, I am not certain which weekend, one of the times that Lee was out.
He wanted to drill a hole in a silver coin for Marina so she could wear it around
her neck, and presumed to use my husband's drill press, which is one of the
many things in the garage, and I complained. But he convinced me that he
knew how to operate it and knew just what he was doing.</p>

<p>So I said, all right, and he proceeded to drill a hole in this coin, and then
Marina showed it to me later. I didn't look closely at it. It wasn't until&mdash;although
I could have perfectly well in this situation. I did see that it was
a foreign coin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was a what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a foreign coin. It was not a coin I recognized. It was
about the size of a silver dollar, but not as thick, as I remember it. And it
was not then until perhaps a week or something less after the assassination
when an FBI agent asked me was there anything left in the house that would
be pertinent, and he and I went together and looked in the drawer in the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
where Marina had been staying, and found there this drilled coin, looked at it
closely, and it was a peso, the Republic of Mexico. This is the first I had
looked at it closely. Also, with this peso was a Spanish-English Dictionary.</p>

<p>My tendency to be very hesitant to look into other people's things was rather
put aside at this point, and I was very curious to see what this book was, and
I observed that the price of it, or what I took to be the price was in a corner
at the front was not in English money, and at the back in his hand or somebody's
hand in small scribble was the notation, "Buy tickets for bull fight, get silver
bracelet for Marina" and there in the drawer also was a silver bracelet with
the name Marina on it, which I took to be associated with this notation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it inscribed on the bracelet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was inscribed, the name Marina. And some picture postcards
with no message, just a picture of Mexico City in this dictionary, and these
I gave to <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you seen any of these items in your home at anytime prior
to this occasion that you have now described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None of these items except the peso which I had not noticed to
be that, seen it, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that is one incident.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is one incident. Another refers to a rough draft of a letter
that Lee wrote and left this rough draft on my secretary desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe the incident? In the meantime, I will obtain
the rough draft here among my notes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. This was on the morning of November 9, Saturday.
He asked to use my typewriter, and I said he might.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Would you please state to the Commission why you
are reasonably firm that it was the morning of November 9? What arrests your
attention to that particular date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Because I remember the weekend that this note or rough draft
remained on my secretary desk. He spent the weekend on it. And the weekend
was close and its residence on that desk was stopped also on the evening of
Sunday, the 10th, when I moved everything in the living room around; the whole
arrangement of the furniture was changed, so that I am very clear in my mind
as to what weekend this was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was using the typewriter. I came and put June in her high-chair
near him at the table where he was typing, and he moved something over
what he was typing from, which aroused my curiosity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did that arouse your curiosity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It appeared he didn't want me to see what he was writing or to
whom he was writing. I didn't know why he had covered it. If I had peered
around him, I could have looked at the typewriter and the page in it, but
I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It did make you curious?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It did make me curious. Then, later that day, I noticed a scrawling
handwriting on a piece of paper on the corner at the top of my secretary
desk in the living room. It remained there.</p>

<p>Sunday morning I was the first one up. I took a closer look at this, a folded
sheet of paper folded at the middle. The first sentence arrested me because
I knew it to be false. And for this reason I then <span class="locked">proceeded&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you just hold it at that moment. This is for purposes of
identification, Mr. Chairman, rather than admission of the document in evidence.
I have marked pages 321 and 322 of Commission Document No. 385 generally
referred to by the staff as the Gemberling Report. He is an FBI agent. I have
now placed that before the witness. You examined that yesterday with me, did
you not, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The document I am now showing you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a transcript, a literal transcript of the document you saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of course the document was in English, transcribing of what
was said; yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By transcript I meant that it has been retyped, that it is literal.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the document; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is interesting. You noticed that the document was in
English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw it. And it was folded at what point, now that you have
the transcript of it before you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the top of what I could see of the paper. In other words, it
was just below the fold. It said, "The FBI is not now interested in my
activities."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that what arrested your attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I then proceeded to read the whole note, wondering, knowing
this to be false, wondering why he was saying it. I was irritated to have him
writing a falsehood on my typewriter, I may say, too. I felt I had some cause
to look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I have your permission, Mr. Chairman. The document is
short. It is relevant to the witness' testimony, and might I read it aloud in the
record to draw your attention to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Without objection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, would you help me by reading it, since you have it
there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Do you want me to leave out all the crossed <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; I wish you would indicate that too.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "Dear Sirs:</p>

<p>"This is to inform you of events since my interview with comrade Kostine in
the Embassy of the Soviet Union, Mexico City, Mexico."</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He typed it early in the morning of that day because after he
typed it we went to the place where you get the test for drivers. It was that
same day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was election day and the driver's license place was closed, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was November 9?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now you have reached the point where you are reading the
letter on the morning of November 10.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right; after I had noticed that it lay on my desk the
previous evening.</p>

<p>"I was unable to remain in Mexico City (because I considered useless&mdash;)"&mdash;because&mdash;it
is crossed out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. In this transcript wherever there
are words stricken out, the transcriber has placed those words in parenthesis
and transcribed the words, but then has written the words "crossed out" to
indicate in the original the words crossed out.</p>

<p>Proceed, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "Indefinitely because of my (visa&mdash;crossed out) Mexican visa
restrictions which was for 15 days only.</p>

<p>"(I had a&mdash;crossed out) I could not take a chance on applying for an extension
unless I used my real name so I returned to the U.S.</p>

<p>"I and Marina Nicholyeva are now living in Dallas, Texas. (You all
ready ha&mdash;crossed out).</p>

<p>"The FBI is not now interested in my activities in the progressive organization
FPCC of which I was secretary in (New Orleans, La.&mdash;crossed out) New Orleans,
Louisiana since I (am&mdash;crossed out) no longer (connected with&mdash;crossed
out) live in that state.</p>

<p>"(November the November&mdash;crossed out) the FBI has visited us here in Texas
on November 1st. Agent of the FBI James P. Hasty warned me that if I
attempt to engage in FPCC activities in Texas the FBI will again take an 'interest'
in me. The agent also 'suggested' that my wife could 'remain in the U.S. under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
FBI protection', that is, she could (refuse to return to the&mdash;crossed out) defect
from the Soviet Union. Of course I and my wife strongly protested these
tactics by the notorious FBI.</p>

<p>"(It was unfortun that the Soviet Embassy was unable to aid me in Mexico
City but&mdash;crossed out) I had not planned to contact the Mexico City Embassy at
all so of course they were unprepared for me. Had I been able to reach Havana
as planned (I could have contacted&mdash;crossed out) the Soviet Embassy there
(for the completion of would have been able to help me get the necessary documents
I required assist me&mdash;crossed out) would have had time to assist me, but
of course the stuip Cuban consule was at fault here. I am glad he has since
been replaced by another."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now I would like to ask you a few questions about your reaction
to that. You had read that in the quiet of your living room on Sunday morning,
the 10th of November.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there were a number of things in that that you thought were
untrue.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Several things I knew to be untrue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You knew to be untrue. Were there things in there that alarmed
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I would say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To me this&mdash;well, I read it and decided to make a copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would having the document back before you help you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, no. I was just trying to think what to say first. And
decided that I should have such a copy to give to an FBI agent coming again,
or to call. I was undecided what to do. Meantime I made a copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did have the instinct to report this to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you made a copy of the document?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I made a copy of the document which should be among
your papers, because they have that too. And after having made it, while the
shower was running, I am not used to subterfuge in any way, but then I put
it back where it had been and it lay the rest of Sunday on my desk top, and of
course I observed this too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is that Lee didn't put it away, just left it out in the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That he didn't put it away or didn't seem to care or notice or
didn't recall that he had a rough draft lying around. I observed it was untrue
that the FBI was no longer interested in him. I observed it was untrue that
the FBI <span class="locked">came&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you observe that that was untrue?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, the FBI came and they asked me, they <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had the FBI been making inquiries of you prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They had been twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. November 1 <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. November 1, and they told me the 5. I made no record of it
whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it was a few days later?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; a few days later. And the first visit I understood to be a
visit to convey to Marina that if any blackmail pressure was being put upon
her, because of relatives back home, that she was invited, if she wished, to
talk about this to the FBI. This is a far cry from being told she could defect
from the Soviet Union, very strong words, and false both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever hear anything at all insofar as the FBI is concerned
reported to you by Marina or Lee Harvey Oswald during all of your
acquaintance with either of them of any suggestion by the FBI or anybody else
that Marina defect in that context to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, absolutely not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or anything of similar import?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing of similar import.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I limited it to the FBI. Any agency of the Government of the
United States?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you see or observe anything during all of that period of
your acquaintance, which stimulated you to think at all or have any notion that
any agency of the Government of the United States was seeking to induce her to
defect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the United States.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, and her terminology in view of it was so completely different
from such stereotyped and loaded words that I was seeing as I read this.
What I was most struck with was what kind of man is this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Why is Lee Oswald writing this? What kind of man? Here
is a false statement that she was invited to defect, false statement that the FBI
is no longer interested, false statement that he was present, "they visited I and
my wife."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was not present. False statement that "I and my wife protested
vigorously." Having not been present he could not protest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was not present when the FBI interviewed you on November 1.
Was Marina present then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was Marina present when the FBI came later on November
5?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She came into the room just after basically the very short visit
was concluded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The second interview was a rather short one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The second interview was conducted standing up. He simply
asked me did I know the address. My memory had been refreshed by him since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The first interview, however, was a rather lengthly one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But it was not strictly speaking an interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was, as Mr. Hosty has described to me later, and I think this
was my impression too of it at the time, an informal opening for confidence.
He presented himself. He talked. We conversed about the weather, about
Texas, about the end of the last World War and changes in Germany at the
time.</p>

<p>He mentioned that the FBI is very careful in their investigations not to bring
anyone they suspect in public light until they have evidence to convict him
in a proper court of law, that they did not convict by hearsay or public
accusation.</p>

<p>He asked me, and here I am answering why I thought it was false to say the
FBI is no longer interested in Lee Oswald; he asked first of all if I knew did
Lee live there, and I said "No." Did I know where he lived? No, I didn't, but
that it was in Dallas.</p>

<p>Did I know where he worked? Yes, I did.</p>

<p>And I said I thought Lee was very worried about losing this job, and the
agent said that well, it wasn't their custom to approach the employer directly.
I said that Lee would be there on the weekend, so far as I knew, that he could
be seen then, if he was interested in talking to Lee.</p>

<p>I want to return now to the fact that I had seen these gross falsehoods and
strong words, concluding with "notorious FBI" in this letter, and gone to say I
wondered whether any of it was true, including the reference to going to Mexico,
including the reference to using a false name, and I still wonder if that was
true or false that he used an assumed name, though I no longer wonder whether
he had actually gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was a subsequent incident in which you did learn that he
used an assumed name, was there not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, a week later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will get to that in a moment. But was <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But this was the first indication I had that this man was a good
deal queerer than I thought, and it didn't tell me, perhaps it should have but
it didn't tell me just what sort of a queer he was. He addressed it "Dear Sirs."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
It looked to me like someone trying to make an impression, and choosing the
words he thought were best to make that impression, even including assumed
name as a possible attempt to make an impression on someone who was able
to do espionage, but not to my mind necessarily a picture of someone who was
doing espionage, though I left that open as a possibility, and thought I'd give
it to the FBI and let them conclude or add it to what they knew.</p>

<p>I regret, and I would like to put this on the record, particularly two things
in my own actions prior to the time of the assassination.</p>

<p>One, that I didn't make the connection between this phone number that I
had of where he lived and that of course this would produce for the FBI agent
who was asking the address of where he lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will get to that, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, that is regret 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't want to cover too many subjects at the moment.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But then of course you see in light of the events that followed
it is a pity that I didn't go directly instead of waiting for the next visit, because
the next visit was the 23d of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now I am going to get to that. What did you do with your
copy of the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I put my copy of the letter away in an envelope in my desk. I
then, Sunday evening, also took the original. I decided to do that Sunday
evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, he had not left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had not left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I asked the gentlemen present, it included Michael, to come in
and help me move the furniture around. I walked in and saw the letter was
still there and plunked it into my desk. We then moved all the furniture. I
then took it out of the desk and placed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you take it out of the desk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think he knew that I took it. Oh, that evening or the
next morning, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was the 10th of November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any conversation with him about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I came close to it. I was disturbed about it. I didn't go
to sleep right away. He was sitting up watching the late spy story, if you
will, on the TV, and I got up and sat there on the sofa with him saying, "I can't
speak," wanting to confront him with this and say, "What is this?" But on
the other hand I was somewhat fearful, and I didn't know what to do.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Fearful in what way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, if he was an agent, I would rather just give it to the FBI,
not to say "Look, I am watching you" by saying "What is this I find on my
desk."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you fearful of any physical harm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I was not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is what I was concerned about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I was not, though I don't think I defined my fears. I sat
down and said I couldn't sleep and he said, "I guess you are real upset about
going to the lawyer tomorrow."</p>

<p>He knew I had an appointment with my lawyer to discuss the possibility of
a divorce the next day, and that didn't happen to be what was keeping me up
that night, but I was indeed upset about the idea, and it was thoughtful for
him to think of it. But I let it rest there, and we watched the story which he
was interested in watching. And then I excused myself and went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do ultimately with your draft of the letter and
the original?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The first appearance of an FBI person on the 23d of November,
I gave the original to them. The next day it probably was I said I also had a
copy and gave them that. I wanted to be shut of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So I take it, Mrs. Paine, you did not deliver either the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
or the copy or call attention to the original or the copy with respect to the FBI.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Prior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prior to the 23d did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what led you to hold onto this rather provocative document?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a rather provocative document. It provoked my doubts
about this fellow's normalcy more than it provoked thoughts that this was the
talk of an agent reporting in. But I wasn't sure.</p>

<p>I of course made no&mdash;I didn't know him to be a violent person, had no thought
that he had this trait, possibility in him, absolutely no connection with the
President's coming. If I had, hindsight is so much better, I would certainly
have called the FBI's attention to it. Supposing that I had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If the FBI had returned, Mrs. Paine, as you indicated during
the course of your meeting with the FBI November 1, would you have disclosed
this document to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I certainly think so. This was not something I was at all
comfortable in having even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you expecting the FBI to return?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did expect them to come back. As I say, I had said that Lee
was here on weekends and so forth. It might have been a good time to give
them this document. But as far as I knew, and I know now certainly, they
had not seen him and they were still interested in seeing him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How did you copy the note?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Handwritten.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Handwritten?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I perhaps should put in here that Lee told me, and I only reconstructed
this a few weeks ago, that he went, after I gave him&mdash;from the
first visit of the FBI agent I took down the agent's name and the number that
is in the telephone book to call the FBI, and I gave this to Lee the weekend he
came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You gave it to Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I gave it to Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What weekend was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am told that came out on the 1st of November, so that would
have been the weekend of the 2d, the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have your calendar there. The 1st of November is what
day of the week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a Friday. Then he told me, it must have been the following
weekend, that same weekend of the 9th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything when you gave him Agent Hosty's name on
the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall anything Lee said. I will go on as to the recollections
that came later. He told me that he had stopped at the downtown office
of the FBI and tried to see the agents and left a note. And my impression of
it is that this notice irritated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Irritating?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Irritated, that he left the note saying what he thought. This
is reconstructing my impression of the fellows bothering him and his family,
and this is my impression then. I couldn't say this was specifically said to him
later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean he was irritated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was irritated and he said, "They are trying to inhibit my
activities," and I said, "You passed your pamphlets," and could well have gone
on to say what I thought, but I don't believe I did go on to say, that he could
and should expect the FBI to be interested in him.</p>

<p>He had gone to the Soviet Union, intended to become a citizen there, and
come back. He had just better adjust himself to being of interest to them for
years to come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say to that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Now as I say, this I didn't go on to say. This was my feeling.</p>

<p>I didn't actually go on to say this. I did say, "Don't be inhibited, do what
you think you should." But I was thinking in terms of passing pamphlets
or expressing a belief in Fidel Castro, if that is why he had, I defend his
right to express such a belief. I felt the FBI would too and that he had no
reason to be irritated. But then that was my interpretation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you given all of what he said and what you said, however,
on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I will just go on to say that I learned only a few weeks
ago that he never did go into the FBI office. Of course knowing, thinking that
he had gone in, I thought that was sensible on his part. But it appears to have
been another lie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will return to that FBI visit in a moment. I want to cover
that as a separate subject.</p>

<p>Representative Ford is interested in another subject. I would like to return
to the day or the period that your station wagon was being parked just before
you took off. You have already testified to the fact, either earlier this afternoon
or late this morning, that Lee Harvey Oswald appeared to be quite active in
doing packing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of household wares or goods that were being taken back to
Irving, Tex. Were you present when the station wagon was loaded with the
various materials?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I was present for most if not all of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who did that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He put the things in. I knew that we would spend one night
on the road, that there were certain things we would have to get too, and I
knew where these were, and he didn't, so that I talked about where these things
should be placed, and helped with some of the binding, tying things to the boat
on the car rack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The boat on top of the station wagon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now would you please tell us what there was in the way of
luggage placed in the station wagon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There again the two large duffels which were heavier than I
could move, he put those in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Describe their appearance, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Again stuffed full, a rumply outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Rumply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rumply? No appearance of any hard object pushing outwards?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Against the sides or ends of the duffel bags?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw nothing with respect to those duffel bags which might
have led you to <span class="locked">believe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A board in it, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A tent pole, a long object, hard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how many pieces of luggage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Again these same suitcases, 2 or 3, I think 3 including quite a
small one, and the little radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about the zipper bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was there. I think so. Oh no, it probably wasn't. I don't
recall the zipper bag as being part of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish you would reflect a little on this because it is important,
Mrs. Paine, if you can remember it as accurately as possible.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall the zipper bag among those things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the zipper bag when you arrived in Irving?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I saw him arrive with it himself, but I am not certain.
No, wait, that may not be because I didn't see him when he first arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you arrived in Irving, Mrs. Paine, not when he arrived.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall that. I distinctly recall the duffels because it was
all I could do to get them off of the car and set them on the grass until Michael
could come and put them into the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you distinctly recall the hard-sided luggage you described
yesterday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All of the pieces that you saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I don't recall that it was all. I couldn't even recall too well
how many went down to New Orleans originally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there more than one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was certainly more than one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you think there were more than two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection as to whether there was a piece of
luggage still apart from the zipper bag, still in the apartment at 4907 Magazine
Street when you girls pulled out to go back to Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no specific recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it fair to say it is your best recollection at the moment that
the zipper bag you have described earlier, you described yesterday, was not
placed in the station wagon, and did not return with you to Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not recall it being in the station wagon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was there a separate long package of any kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not recall such a package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a separate package of any character wrapped in a
blanket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. There was a basket such as you use for hanging your
clothes. It carried exactly that, clothes and diapers, and they weren't as neat
as being in suitcases and duffels would imply. There was leftovers stuffed in
the corner, clothes and things, but rather open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you saw no long rectangular package of any kind or character
loaded in or placed in your station wagon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, it doesn't mean it wasn't there, but I saw nothing of that
nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw nothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I saw nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you arrived in Irving, Tex., were you present when your
station wagon was unpacked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina and I did that with the exception of the duffels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did it all yourself and you took out of the station wagon
everything in it other than the two duffel bags?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in the process of removing everything other than the two
duffel bags on the occasion on the 24th of September 1963 when you reached
Irving, Tex., did you find or see any long rectangular package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall no such package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see any kind of a package wrapped in the blanket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see any <span class="locked">package&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall seeing the blanket either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On that occasion, not until later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not until later.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you see the blanket in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the bed or something. I am asking myself. I don't recall it
specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of course we all know the blanket to which we are referring,
which I will ask you about in a moment. I might show it to you at the moment,
or at least ask you if it is the blanket. I am exhibiting to the witness Commission
Exhibit No. 140. Is this blanket familiar to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And give us the best recollection you have when you first saw it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is that I saw it on the floor of my garage
sometime in late October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection of ever having seen it before that
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I might say also now that I know certainly I have never
seen this binding until last night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "this binding," you are pointing to what appears
to be some black binding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Some hemstitching, it is sewn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the edge of the blanket.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. This binding was not apparent, did not show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never noticed the binding before, if the binding had always
been on it, is that what you mean to say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I saw the blanket the binding was not showing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How carefully did you analyze the blanket on the
previous occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I stepped over it. I didn't pick it up or look at it closely.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Didn't turn it over?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Didn't move it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So you only saw one surface more or less?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, only one surface, except I saw that it had been moved.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But you didn't move it yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what shape, that is form, was the blanket when you first saw
it? And I take it you first saw it in your garage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was subsequent to the time that you and Marina had
returned to Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are certain that you did not see the blanket in your
station wagon when you arrived in Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not recall seeing the blanket in my station wagon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you didn't see it in their apartment at 4907 Magazine Street
when you were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall seeing it there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either in the spring or in the fall, is that true?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now tell us&mdash;I take it from your testimony that the blanket,
when you first saw it in a garage, was in a configuration in the form of a package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a long rectangle shape with the ends tucked in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you be good enough to re-form that blanket so that it is
in the shape and the dimension when you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. About like so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the record if you please, Mr. Chairman, the length of the
form is just exactly 45 inches, and it is across exactly 12 inches.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is across lying flat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Across lying flat, thank you.</p>

<p>Now, what else about the form of the blanket did you notice on the occasion
when you first saw it on your garage floor? Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall from either that occasion or another that there were
parallel strings around it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Into a bundle, yes, 3 or 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 3 or 4, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 3 or 4?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I suppose it would be four. It would be very well spaced
if it was only three, and I think they were closer than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your best recollection now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rather than rationalization.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, there were four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There were four string ties across the 12-inch side of the blanket.
Were those string ties pulled so they seemed to hold something inside the
blanket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They didn't seem particularly tight, but then I don't have a strong
recollection of them prior to the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever pick up that package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was wrapped in the blanket. Did you ever have any discussion
with Marina Oswald about the package in your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not until the afternoon of the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see anybody move it about your garage at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I did not see anyone move it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long after you returned to Texas did you notice that
package in your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said I thought it was late October perhaps. I wouldn't be at all
certain about when I first noticed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you notice from time to time that it was in a different
position or places in your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall two places I saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the first was where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Over near&mdash;the radial saw, what do you call it, buzz saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bandsaw.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, buzz saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh yes, a disc type, a buzz saw, near the buzz saw. Then on the
second occasion when you saw it, where was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Over near the work bench in front of part of the work bench, one
end extending toward the bandsaw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on both of those occasions was the package lying flat on the
floor or was it upended?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Flat on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you never had any curiosity with respect to it to lead you to
step on it or feel it in any respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a lot of debris or articles in the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed, and do yet. Our things and most of the Oswald things
were stored there. I have mentioned several pieces of machine tools.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We identified the garage picture at the tail end of yesterday, and
I think the Chairman is seeking it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I am trying to find it now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That of course was taken more recently, but it is reasonably typical
of its condition at that time too.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is a photograph numbered eight, entitled garage interior,
which I have marked with Commission number 429, and I now exhibit that to
Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with what is depicted in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know when that photograph was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was taken about 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does it accurately depict everything that was there and
in its relative position at the time the picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you locate on that, and I would like to have you place
an X at the point in that picture that you first saw the package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Underneath that box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You have written an arrow or X next to "on floor"
and it is underneath the box that is on the floor.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was in front as I recall it; this was the buzz saw I was talking
about, right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Right here the witness is pointing to the right hand upper
middle section of the photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is this the first location of the package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was over on that side of the garage, towards the door <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The first location of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Toward what door, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Toward the front of the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you see it on the second occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Part of it in front of this work bench, one right under this box
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Put a double X here, between this workbench and this bandsaw.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The workbench and the bandsaw to which the witness is pointing
are on the left hand side of the photograph, the bandsaw being about the
upper middle. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. The package was farther to the interior from the bench.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was toward the back rather than toward the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was the other side of the bandsaw so it was farther to the
interior than its first location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 429 the document
which the witness has identified which in turn was identified as Commission
Exhibit 429.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to, previously identified as Commission Exhibit
No. 429, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the record, I am placing the rifle in the folded blanket as
Mrs. Paine folded it. This is being done without the rifle being dismantled.</p>

<p>May the record show, Mr. Chairman, that the rifle fits well in the package
from end to end, and it does <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Can you make it flatter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; because the rifle is now in there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I just mean <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that about the appearance of the blanket wrapped package
that you saw on your garage floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; although I recall it as quite flat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Flatter than it now appears to be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. But it is not a clear recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a firm recollection that the package you saw was
of the length?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is 45 inches, approximately. You had no occasion when
you stepped on the <span class="locked">package&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I stepped over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You always stepped over it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; until the afternoon of the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By accident or otherwise, did you happen to come in contact
with it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't know whether there was anything solid or hard in
it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did it look about the way this package looks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Except for the fact it had some cord around it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When it had some cord around it, did the way it was
tied pull it in or distort the shape?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it didn't distort the shape.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. About the same shape even with the cord?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The cords weren't pulled tight?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were relatively loosely tied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall this definite shape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To hold the blanket in that form rather than to hold the contents
of the package firm, is that your impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Are you going to ask about the husband's testimony in connection
with the moving of the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I did not intend to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I was not present but your husband testified he had moved
the blanket from time to time but had not opened it. Did he ever refer to it?
Did he ever speak to you about having had to move it while he <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not until after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Not until after the assassination but before the assassination
he had not complained about its being there or any difficulty in moving it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not mention it, and I was not present when he moved
it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was he the person who used these various woodworking
pieces of equipment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he work in the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, he had&mdash;he made the workbench, and he had worked in
the garage when he lived at the home and it has since been somewhat filled up.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But during the time that you and Marina came back
he didn't work in the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did still cut occasionally something on the saws. Indeed, I
did, too. I like to make children's blocks. I am trying to think when I last,
if it is pertinent, when I used the saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you use the saw while the blanket was on floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You had to step over the blanket to do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or around it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Or around it. But in the course of your use of the saw you
never had the necessity or the occasion to readjust the blanket or move it in any
way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did we get the three locations here? I only see two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There were only two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Only two.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She made a mistake in the first drawing of the second
one.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I touched it by mistake.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think that ought to be clarified on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the right-hand side of Commission Exhibit 429 there is an X
or an arrow above which is written the words "on floor". That is the first
location point at which you saw the package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the left-hand side, the lower half of the photograph there
is a double X.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which I could not put in enough to give the proportion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean in the photograph?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that where you saw the package for the second time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; as I have described it. The position I have described is
more accurate than the XX.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is a red strip above the table with the tablecloth on it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is an accident with my hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was an accident on your part?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So there are only two locations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. Chairman, may I reinsert the rifle in the package, on
the opposite side from what it was before, and have the witness look at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You may.</p>

<p>We are back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have now placed the opposite side of the rifle to the floor,
and may the record show that the package is much flatter. The rifle when
inserted firstly was turned on the side of the bolt which operates the rifle which
forced it up higher.</p>

<p>Now does the package look more familiar to you, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall it as being more like this, not as lumpy as the other had
been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. More in the form it is now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now directing your attention to the rifle itself, which is Commission
Exhibit 139, when did you first see that rifle, if you have ever seen it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I saw a rifle I judge to have been the same one at the police
station on the afternoon of November 22, I don't recall the strap.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't recall at the time you saw it on the 22d of November
in the police station that it had a strap?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It may well have had one but I don't specifically recall it. I was
interested in the sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you ever seen this rifle prior to the afternoon of November
22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we do have some particular interest, Mrs. Paine, in the
rifle strap. Had you ever had around your house a luggage strap or a guitar
strap similar to the strap that appears on Commission Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; in fact, I don't recall ever seeing a strap of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whether in your home or anywhere else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Precisely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are unable to identify or suggest its source?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you have in your home, Mrs. Paine, by way of heavy
wrapping paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have the sort of paper you buy at the dime store to wrap
packages, about 36 inches long, coming in a roll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibiting to you Commission Exhibit No. 364, is the wrapping
paper that you have in your home as heavy as that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe it is quite that heavy and it certainly isn't quite
that long. Well, it could have been cut the otherway, couldn't it, possibly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about its shade, color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It would be similar to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Similar in shade.</p>

<p>Do you have the broad banded sticky tape or sticky tape of this nature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is no tape this wide in my home nor to my recollection has
there ever been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have whole rolls of this tape, of the paper in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A whole roll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A whole roll?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which I use for wrapping packages, mailing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have string in your home that you use in attaching to
this wrapping?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you by any chance know the weight of the string that
wrapped the blanket package as against the strength or weight of the string
that you normally used in your home for packages?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was similar in weight, rather thin.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Color was the same?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was a whitish color on the blanket and one of the
rolls I have is that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say it was a relatively light package string?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not a rope type?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the string you saw on the blanket package was of the
lighter weight type and <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And of the lighter color too, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the lighter color.</p>

<p>Now, you and Marina arrived home on the 24th of September, with the packages
and contents of the station wagon, and, save the duffel bags, they were moved
into your home, and everybody settled down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When next was there&mdash;did you hear from Lee Harvey Oswald at
any time thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not until the afternoon of the 4th, which I have already referred
to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No word whatsoever from him from the 24th of September?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 23d we left him in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 23d of September, until the 4th of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct; no word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By letter, telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or pigeon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or otherwise, anything whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and Marina have discussions in that 10-day period about
where Lee was or might be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever? Did you have any discussion about the fact
that you hadn't heard from Lee Harvey Oswald in 14 days or 10 days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; we didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No discussion on that at all. What did you and Marina discuss
during that 10-day period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall which was during that period or which was after;
general conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it generally small talk, ladies talk about the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was generally what my vocabulary permitted and then she
would reminisce, her vocabulary being much larger, about her life in Russia,
about the movies she had seen. We talked about the children and their health.
We talked about washing, about cooking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have ladies visit. Did ladies in the neighborhood come
and visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you go to neighbors homes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Again, I can't recall which was before October 4th and which
was after, but there was the normal flow <span class="locked">nonetheless&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And interested people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of my visiting at other people's homes and particularly Mrs.
Roberts or Mrs. Craig.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Roberts was your next door neighbor and Mrs. Craig was
how many doors down or across the street?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She is, you have to drive. You have to drive to her home. She
is the young German woman to whom I referred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Was there any discussion during this 10-day period of
Marina's relations with her husband, Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She expressed no concern during this 10-day period, that no word
had been heard from Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she evidence any&mdash;did she do or say anything during that
period to indicate she did not expect to hear from him during that 10 days period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was nothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it come to your mind that it was curious you hadn't heard
from Lee Harvey Oswald for 10 whole days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it didn't seem curious. I know he had spent at least 2
weeks looking for work on previous occasions in different cities and I thought he
wanted to find something before he communicated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But in view of the affection that had been evidenced on the day
of departure on the 23d, you were not bothered by the fact that not even a telephone
call had been received in 10 days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If he was not in town I wouldn't have at all expected a telephone
call because that would have cost him dearly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He might have made it collect.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't expect that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But there was no telephone call, there was no postcard, there was
no letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was nothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There could well have been a letter but there was none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where did you think he was at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Houston, looking for a job? Houston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Houston, possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because of the conversation on the morning of the 23d, because
of the possibility of his going to Houston or Philadelphia, your frame of mind
was that he was either in Houston or Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought he probably was in Houston. The Philadelphia reference
was very slight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any reference or discussion between you and Marina
during that period of the possibility that he was off in Houston looking for work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are sure there was just no discussion of the subject at all
during that whole 10 days period with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall any discussion of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She expressed no concern and you none?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That nobody had heard from Lee.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>You heard from him on the 4th of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give the Commission the circumstances, the time of
day and how it came about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He telephoned in early afternoon, something after lunchtime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The phone rang. Did you answer it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you recognize the voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He asked to speak to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose voice was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, after he asked to speak to Marina, I was certain it was
Lee's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said "here" and gave her the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't say "where are you", or "I am glad to hear from
you, where have you been?"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I thought that was her's to ask. He wished to speak to
her and I gave her the phone and, of course, that is what was then asked. I
heard her say to <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard her side of the conversation, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>What did you hear her say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I heard her say, "No, Mrs. Paine, she can't come and pick you
up."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she speaking in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Throughout?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When Lee asked for Marina, did he speak in English or Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall. And Marina went on to say that Mrs. Paine,
"Ruth has just been to Parkland Hospital this morning to donate blood, she
shouldn't be going driving now to pick you up."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she refer to you as Mrs. Paine or Ruth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I am trying to make it clear who is being talked about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. You might give your testimony the wrong cast.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; of course. She referred to me as "Ruth" or "she".</p>

<p>To Junie, she called me Aunt Ruth. To Junie, speaking of me to her little
girl, she referred to me as Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are giving the conversation now, the end of it that you
heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Then I heard Marina say "Why didn't you call?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did hear her say that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe so. I certainly remember her saying it afterward.
She hung up and she explained the conversation to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That he had asked for me to come in to downtown Dallas
to pick him up and she said no; he should find his own way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To come to downtown Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To come to downtown Dallas to pick him up, and she never
asked me whether I wanted to or would have, told him, no; it was an imposition,
that I had just given blood at Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had in fact given blood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes; indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I have a card or the FBI does to that effect. Then she
said that he had said that he was at the Y, staying at the Y, and had been
in town a couple of days, to which she said, "Why didn't you call right away?",
in other words, "why didn't you call right away upon getting to town?"</p>

<p>Then he also asked whether he could come out; this was, of course, during
the conversation, and she referred the question to me, could he come out for the
weekend, and I said, yes, he could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was while she was still talking on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Prior to his asking for a ride.</p>

<p>So then they hung up and I went grocery shopping, and <span class="locked">when&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You left the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I left the home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have now exhausted your recollection as to everything
that was said to you by Marina after she hung up and was relating to you,
at least a summary of the conversation with her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe it was also said that he wanted to look for work in
Dallas. He was here, staying at the Y. Could he come out for the weekend.
He planned to look for work in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Did you say anything about&mdash;were you stimulated to say anything to Marina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
about any of the subject matters of that conversation as she reported it to
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You expressed no response, made no response to her having made
a statement to her husband that&mdash;of her surprise as to why he hadn't called
and if he were just over in Dallas and staying at the Y?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought that but I didn't try to put it in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was no discussion is all I am getting at.</p>

<p>What did she say as to his coming out by whatever means he could get
there? Was there any discussion of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It implied whatever means, that he shouldn't ask me <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was coming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But that you were not going to go to get him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you left and went to the grocery store or market?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you returned, was Lee at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was already there, which surprised me greatly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did it surprise you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Because I thought he would have to take a public bus to Irving,
they run very rarely if at all during the afternoon, and I thought he would
have considerable difficulty getting out. I thought it would be at least supper
time before he got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How much time elapsed between the time you left and the
time you returned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Shopping? Oh, I don't know, perhaps an hour, perhaps a little
less.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where did you go shopping?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The grocery store in the same parking lot where we practiced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was three blocks away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a little more than that. These would be long blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any conversation ensue as to how he had, by what means
he had come from Dallas to Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. He then said that he had hitchhiked out, caught a ride
with someone who brought him straight to the door, a Negro man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To your door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. To whom he said that he had been away from his wife
and child and he was just now getting home, and the man kindly brought him
directly to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did this conversation take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the home that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you returned to your home, that was in the afternoon,
wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he inside the home or outside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Inside, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any conversation ensue as to where he had been in that
10-day interim?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Where he had been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where he had been in the intervening 10 days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he said to me that he had been in Houston and that he hadn't
been able to find work there and was now going to try in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your testimony I gather he did not say anything about
Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina present when he stated to you that he had been
in Houston looking for work?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection of it; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never had any conversation with her up to the 23d or 22d
of November on the subject of whether Lee had or had not been in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We never had such a conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Despite your having read that letter on the 10th of November
in which he stated that he had been?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Now there was no occasion in that letter that she may have
known that he went any more than there was certain indication to my mind
that this was true and not false. Had I looked at the peso, this would have
been the only occasion that she knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But the fact is, apart from your rationalization now there was
no conversation on that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did he remain in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Monday <span class="locked">morning&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Before you get to that, I want to ask a question about giving
the blood that day. Did you give it for a particular person or for a blood bank?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was for Marina. For each of the persons who come in under
county care they ask you to donate two pints of blood, one at a time.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I see. And you donated one pint for her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did he remain in your home on this visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Until Monday morning, the 7th of October, almost noon, in fact,
when I took him to an Intercity bus at the Irving bus station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is that bus terminal approximately 3 miles from your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That same day I gave him a map to assist him in job hunting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I would like to get to that.</p>

<p>I show you what is in evidence, I don't know whether it is received or not;
it is a Commission Exhibit No. 128, and ask you if you have ever seen that
before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the map to which you now have reference?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do with the map with respect to Lee Harvey Oswald
on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall who asked, who mentioned a map first, but, of
course, I knew, and he did, that it would be a useful thing to have job hunting.
I think he asked if I had a map of the city of Dallas and I said, yes, I did,
and I can easily get another at the gas station, one of these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, it is your clear recollection that this document,
Commission Exhibit No. 128, a map, is the map that you gave Lee Harvey
Oswald, this was October 7th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was certainly this kind of map, whether it is the identical
map, I couldn't say for sure, but I much prefer the ENCO map of the city
and this is the kind I always get to use. So this is the kind I had in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, to the best of your recollection, the coloring has been changed
a little bit because of attempts to draw fingerprints from it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But your best recollection now, observing it, is that this is the
document?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you examine it carefully and see that there might be
something on it that would arrest your attention as your having placed thereon
or Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have examined this carefully and a copy of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On other occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On other occasions, and I could not at any time find a marking
that I had made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall having made any markings?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not recall having made any markings on this particular map.
Sometime on some maps I knew I had made remarks where I was going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just for the purpose of the record, may I reverse it, and you
see no markings on the reverse side, I take it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; which is Fort Worth, not Dallas, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>All right, now tell us about that incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all there was to it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you suggest, was there any discussion of, particular places
of employment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no such discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As to which he might inquire?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he&mdash;did you hand him the map?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it opened before you and Lee in your discussions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, no; we didn't discuss. He said, do I have a map, and I said,
yes, I do, you may have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You handed it to him, and that was all that occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he place it in his pocket or did he go into his room or
his and Marina's room and place it there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He may have already been on his way to the bus station when
this conversation occurred and took it with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I notice what appears to be a notation that the document has not as yet been
offered in evidence, Mr. Chairman, and I offer in evidence, therefore, as Commission
Exhibit No. 128, the document heretofore identified by that exhibit
number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to, heretofore marked as Commission Exhibit No. 128
for identification, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina present during this discussion of his job hunting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall. I seem to think we were on our way out already to
go in our car to the bus station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina accompany you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She stayed home with the baby. My children probably went with
me, I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the baby, you mean June?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You drove into the bus terminal approximately 3 miles from your
home. Did you remain until the bus came along?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw him depart?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said about where he would reside in Dallas before
he left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not certain, but I think he said the Y was rather expensive.
He was going to look for a room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What was the date you took him into the bus station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the 7th of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The 7th of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there an occasion in this early period that you drove him all
the way into Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall ever driving him all the way into Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We drove, except to the Oak Cliff Station for this driver training
test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the only occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is the only one I recall. Can you refresh my memory.
I can't think of any other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are clear that you drove him from your home to the bus
terminal in Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And either you left immediately or waited to see him board the
bus, but it is your definite recollection you did not drive him to the Dallas downtown
area on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I did once drive him to the Dallas downtown area, because
I recall where he got out. Now why I was going&mdash;yes, I think I may know why
I was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fix the time first.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do recall now driving him into downtown Dallas because I was
already going and it was probably Monday, the 14th of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the day before his employment began with the Texas
School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It would have been 2 days before, the day before he applied. I
have several recollections but which day they attach to is not quite as clear.</p>

<p>I recall taking him to the bus. I recall picking him up at the bus. I recall
going in and dropping him off at a corner of Ross Avenue and something else,
which was near the employment office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In downtown Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Near the employment office station. I was on my way to get a
key fixed on my Russian typewriter which is what was taking me downtown.
I hadn't been thinking&mdash;I at no time made a purposeful trip just to take him to
downtown Dallas, but I was going and he went along and I am pretty sure that
was a Monday and he got out at that corner and Marina was with me and we
went on to get this typewriter fixed either to pick it up or to leave it. I am quite
certain it was the 12th, Saturday, that I picked him up at the station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the bus terminal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. And I am pretty certain that it was the 7th I took him to
the bus station. I recall it being already noon, and I thought he might well have
started looking for a job earlier that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When next did you hear from Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. After the 7th. Probably on the 12th when he called again to ask
if he could come out for the weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The 12th is what day of the week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The 12th is a Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that he did call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you recall that he did telephone and ask permission to come?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, indeed he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he always do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He always did that with the exception of the 21st of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will get to that in a very few moments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Before you get to that you said you went all the way into Dallas
with this errand, that Marina was with you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What did you do with the children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We always take them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Took them all, put them all in the station wagon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; big station wagon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, I would like to go back a little. When you picked
him up at the bus station on the afternoon of the 4th of October, what did he
<span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the afternoon of the 12th, around noon of the 12th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, when he first returned to Irving <span class="locked">after&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He hitchhiked out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the occasion that he told you he had been in Houston looking
for a job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The 4th, he hitchhiked out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>It is that occasion that I have in mind.</p>

<p>What did he have with him in the way of luggage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall certainly. It does seem to me that I remember
he took the zipper bag on Monday, the following Monday, with him to town,
along with some clothes over his arm, ironed shirts, things that are hung on
hangers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With respect to that <span class="locked">trip&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You must remember I was shopping when he arrived on the
afternoon of the 4th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So I didn't see him when he arrived that moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have a recollection of having seen the zipper bag on
Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The 7th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you took him to the bus terminal for the purpose of his
returning to downtown Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To find a room and live there and have sufficient clothing there.</p>

<p>That is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the first time you had seen the zipper bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the time you had left New Orleans on the 23d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So far as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you notice anything else in the way of pieces of luggage in
your home after you came back from the shopping center that afternoon of
October 4th that hadn't been there prior to his arrival?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The only piece of luggage of which you have any recollection
then is the zipper bag which you saw him take with him when he left on Monday
morning, the 7th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And that is, I would not say a certain recollection. But that is
the best I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is your best recollection anyhow?</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when you returned to your home did you have any discussion
with Marina about Lee's departure and his future plans and her understanding
of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; nothing I recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None at all.</p>

<p>What discussion went on between you and Marina, that is the subject matter
with respect to his weekend visits?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She wanted to be certain it was all right for him to come out,
you know that it wasn't too much of an imposition on me. We got into discussing
his efforts to find a job. Then Monday, the 14th as best as I recall, was the first
time we talked about him, more than to say it was too bad he didn't find something.
This is <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the course of the week was there discussion between you
and Marina respecting Lee Oswald's attempt at employment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there came an occasion, did there not, that weekend or the
following weekend at which there was a discussion at least by you with some
neighbors with respect to efforts to obtain employment for Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As best I can reconstruct it this was, while having coffee at my
immediate neighbors, Mrs. Ed Roberts, and also present was Mrs. Bill Randle,
and Lee had said over the weekend that he had gotten the last of the unemployment
compensation checks that were due him, and that it had been smaller than
the others had been, and disappointing in its smallness and he looked very
discouraged when he went to look for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about amount?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't hear the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about amount?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he didn't, just less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And the subject of his looking for work and that he hadn't found
work for a week, came up while we were having coffee, the four young mothers
at Mrs. Roberts' house, and Mrs. Randle mentioned that her younger brother,
Wesley Frazier thought they needed another person at the Texas School Book
Depository where Wesley worked.</p>

<p>Marina then asked me, after we had gone home, asked me if I would <span class="locked">call&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina present during this discussion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; Marina was present, yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she understand the conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a running translation, running, faulty translation going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were translating for her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was acting as her translator. And then after we came home
she asked me if I would call the School Book Depository to see if indeed there
was the possibility of an opening, and at her request, I did <span class="locked">telephone&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While you were still in the Roberts' home was there any discussion
at all of the subject mentioned by you or by Mrs. Randle or Mrs. Roberts or
anyone else, of calls to be made, or that might be made, to the Texas School Book
Depository in this connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall this discussion. As I recall it was a suggestion
made by Marina to me after we got home, but I may be wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But that is your best recollection that you are now testifying to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You reached home and Marina suggested that "Would you please
call the Texas School Depository?"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I looked up the number in the book, and dialed it, was told I
would need to speak to Mr. Truly, who was at the warehouse. The phone was
taken to Mr. Truly, and I talked with him and <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean the call was transferred by the operator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To Mr. Truly, and I said I know of a young man whose wife was
staying in my house, the wife was expecting a child, they already had a little girl
and he had been out of work for a while and was very interested in getting any
employment and his name, and was there a possibility of an opening there, and
Mr. Truly said he didn't know whether he had an opening, that the young man
should apply himself in person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which made sense.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Made very good sense for a personnel man to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make more than one call to this Texas School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Only the one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Only the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the date of this call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Reconstructing it, I believe it was October 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What day of the week is October 14?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Following that call and your talking with Mr. Truly, what did
you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Began to get dinner. Then Lee call the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the early evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you talk with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina talked with him, then asked&mdash;then Marina asked me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
tell Lee in English what had transpired regarding the possible job opening, and
then I did say that there might be an opening in the School Book Depository, that
Mr. Truly was the man to apply to. Shall I go on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The next <span class="locked">day&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, I meant go on as far as the conversation was
concerned.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is all there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, I would like to return just for a moment to the
conversation in the Roberts' home.</p>

<p>Was any possible place of employment in addition to the Texas School Depository
mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no recollection of any other suggestion as to possible
places of employment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no recollection of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no recollection of any other, at least two other places
being suggested, and you, in turn, stating that they would be unsatisfactory, one
because an automobile had to be used, or it would be necessary for Lee to have an
automobile, and the other that he was lacking in the possible qualifications
needed? None of that refreshes your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None of that refreshes my recollection. I certainly know that I
thought, for instance, he couldn't have applied to Bell Helicopter or to any
place apart from the city area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But Bell Helicopter was not mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall it being mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband is employed by Bell Helicopter, is he not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you made an inquiry of your husband as to the possibility
of employment by Lee Harvey Oswald with Bell Helicopter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I hadn't, especially knowing that he had no way of getting
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Unless he knew how to drive a car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Unless he knew how to drive a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't believe he was proficient enough at this moment to
operate it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We have got on record here that I gave him the first lesson on
the 13th of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in any event were you aware he had no driver's license?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I certainly was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Especially that week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you give him the telephone number and the address of the
Texas School Book Depository on the occasion when you talked to him, this is
the 14th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The address, I don't think so. I probably gave the phone number.
I don't recall that I gave him an address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Directing your attention to your address book, you have an
entry in your address book of the Texas School Depository, do you not? Would
you turn to that page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have it here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there an entry of address of the Texas School Depository on
that page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; which I believe I made after he gained employment there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rather than at the time that you advised him of this possibility?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you made an entry of the telephone number of the Texas
School Book Depository on that date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have and of the address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the telephone number and the address of the Texas
School Depository Building <span class="locked">where&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On Elm Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I heard you mention the Texas School Depository warehouse.
Did you think the warehouse was at 411 Elm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I had seen a sign on a building as I went along one of
the limited access highways that leads into Dallas, saying "Texas School Book
Depository Warehouse" and there was the only building that had registered on
my consciousness as being Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>I was not aware, hadn't taken in the idea of there being two buildings and
that there was one on Elm, though, I copied the address from the telephone
book, and could well have made that notation in my mind but I didn't.</p>

<p>The first I realized that there was a building on Elm was when I heard on
the television on the morning of the 22d of November that a shot had been
fired from such a building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of this record then I would like to emphasize
you were under the impression then, were you, that Lee Harvey Oswald was
employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the warehouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than at 411, a place at 411 Elm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought he worked at the warehouse. I had in fact, pointed
out the building to my children going into Dallas later after he had gained
employment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever discuss with Lee Harvey Oswald where he actually
was employed, that is the location of the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever mention it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There never was any discussion between you and, say, young Mr.
Frazier or Mrs. Randle or anyone in the neighborhood as to where the place
of employment is located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. It may be significant here to say, my letter to which I have
already <span class="locked">referred&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit <span class="locked">No.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 425, which says, "Lee Oswald is looking for work in Dallas,"
does not give a time of day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the date of that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. October 14, Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the letter to your mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But I don't normally write letters any time except when the
children are asleep, they sometimes nap but usually this is in the evening.</p>

<p>If it were in the evening it means that he had gotten the suggestion as to a
place to apply, but I didn't mention that. I only mentioned that he was
looking and was discouraged.</p>

<p>I bring this out simply to say that I had no real hopes that he would get
a job at the School Book Depository.</p>

<p>I didn't think it too likely that he would, but it was worth a try.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear from him then either on the 14th or 15th in respect
to his effort to obtaining employment at the Texas School Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He called immediately on Tuesday, the 15th, after he had been
accepted and said he would start work the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say immediately, what time of day was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Midmorning I would say, which was contrary to his usual practice
of calling in the early evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, is the call from Dallas, Tex., to Irving a toll
call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is its cost, 10 cents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I expect so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you answer the phone on the occasion he called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He asked for Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He said nothing to you about his success?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As soon as you answered he asked for Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he identify himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; but I am certain he knew that I knew who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recognized his voice, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You called her to the phone.</p>

<p>Did you hear her end of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What took place by way of of conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said, "Hurray, he has got a job." Immediately telling me
as she still talked to the telephone that he had been accepted for work at the
school book depository and thanks to me and she said, "We must thank Mrs.
Randle."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you return to the telephone and speak with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not. Where was he residing then, did you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had any information that he was not residing at
the YMCA?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you come by that information?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He gave me a telephone number, possibly this same weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is of importance, Mrs. Paine. Would you give us the
circumstances, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said that he was at <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, where was he when he said this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was at the home so far as I remember. It might have
been during one of his telephone calls to the house, but I don't think so. He
rarely talked with me when he was out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This would be the weekend of what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So this must have been the weekend of the 12th of October, the
same weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the weekend following his return to Dallas on the
7th of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Fourth of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He departed on the 7th.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His return to Dallas, I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; now, give it as chronologically as you can; how you came
by that telephone number, the circumstances under which it was given to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said this is the telephone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. He said of the room where he was staying, renting a room,
and I could reach him here if she went into labor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see, the coming of the baby was imminent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was the baby expected?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Any time after the first week in October. Any time, in other
words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The obstetrician predicted the birth of the child as when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As due on the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina have a different notion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She thought it might be due around the 8th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So there was a considerable variance in the expectation between
the date and when the baby actually did arrive? When did the baby actually
arrive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the 20th of October, a Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he give you more than one telephone number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At this occasion did he give you more than one telephone number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just stick to this particular occasion. What telephone number&mdash;did
you record it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In ink in my telephone book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your telephone and address book?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you opened that telephone address book to the page in
which you have made that recording?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the page you identified yesterday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, may I examine it for a moment here.</p>

<p>Now, relate for the record the telephone number that Mr. Oswald gave you,
the first one he gave you on this particular occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The number was WH 2-1985.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is at the bottom of the page written in ink.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What exchange is "WH" in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know. I did not know. I know now, maybe I know,
Whitehall, something. I know now what it is, but I didn't know then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he on that occasion say anything about where the apartment
or room was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did not give you an address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Didn't locate it in any area in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All he gave you was the telephone number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything that would indicate to you that you are
other than free to call him and ask for him by his surname you knew him by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not make such a limitation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from your testimony that the number was given to
you, at least the discussion was, so that you could call him in connection with
the oncoming event of the birth of his child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Am I correct about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have mentioned a second number that Mr. Oswald,
Lee Harvey Oswald, gave you. Did you receive that second number subsequent
to the birth of Rachel or prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Also prior to the birth of Rachel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, relate for the Commission the circumstances under which
you received a second number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He gave me a second number, I suppose by phone, but I don't
recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was certainly before the birth of the baby because again it
was so that I could reach him if she went to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He called you or related this to you in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He either called you by telephone or he was present in your
home and gave you the second number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which recollection serves you best, that he called or that he
gave it to you in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said he moved to different rooms, was paying a dollar a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
week more, $8 instead of $7; incidentally, I needed to know how much he was
paying in order to put this on the form of Parkland Hospital, but that it was a
little more comfortable and he had television privileges and privileges to use
the refrigerator. And he gave me this number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was after he obtained employment with the Texas School
Book Depository, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would rationalize that I have judged so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the second occasion did he give you the location or even the
area in Dallas where his second room was located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the telephone number given you with any reservation as
to when you might call him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No such reservation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any indication that you should ask him, asking for him by other
than his surname by which you knew him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No such indication.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the baby was born on <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Twentieth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Twentieth of October. Was Lee present, in town, I mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was at the house in Irving when labor began, and stayed
at the house to take care of June and my two children who were sleeping while
I took Marina to the hospital since I was the one who could drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. The 20th is&mdash;when did you take her to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Around 9 o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Sunday, the 20th of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee Harvey Oswald was out there on that weekend on one
of his regular visits?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. The first one since he had employment.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you ever call either one of those numbers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. We will get to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You will forgive me because I would like to bring out the
particular circumstances of the call.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee go back into town on Monday to go to work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he did. I informed him in the morning that he had a
baby girl. He was already asleep when I got back&mdash;no; that is not right. He
was not asleep when I got back from the hospital, but he had gone to bed, and
I stayed up and waited to call the hospital to hear what word there was. So,
that I knew after he was already asleep that he had a baby girl. I told him in
the morning before he went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You called him in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am a little confused.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I am sorry, I will begin again. I took her to the hospital
and then I returned. I didn't feel I could stay. I thought I should get back
to my children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Sunday night.</p>

<p>He went to bed, put Junie to bed. I stayed up and waited until what I
considered a proper time and then called the hospital to hear what news there
was. They had implied I could come and visit, too, but that would have been
incorrect, and learned that he had a baby girl. I then went to bed and told
him in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not awaken him then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not awaken him. I thought about it and I decided if
he was not interested in being awake I would tell him in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the morning was Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having learned that he was the father of a baby girl, I assume
you told him that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he go to work that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he return to Irving that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. It was agreed when he left that he would return that
evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did he&mdash;was he brought back to Irving that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I imagine Wesley brought him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least you did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he visit with Marina at the hospital that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When he arrived it was not decided whether he would go to the
hospital or not. He thought not, and I thought he should, and encouraged
him to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did he think he ought not to go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am uncertain about this. This thought crossed my mind that
perhaps he thought they would find out he was working, but I had already told
them he was working since I had been asked at the hospital when she was
admitted and I mentioned this and it may have changed his mind about going,
but this is conjecture on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event he did go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did go. It was a good thing as he was the only one admitted,
I was not either a father or grandmother so I was not permitted to get in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see, and you waited until his visit was over and returned
home with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he return to work the next morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When next did you hear from him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The following Friday he came out again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know how he returned to Dallas that following morning,
that is the 22d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably went with Wesley also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he came out the following weekend, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. That was his birthday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The 18th of October is his birthday. Did you have a party
for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We had a cake; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that weekend uneventful?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, Marina was already home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The baby was now home. She came home very quickly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very quickly, a day and a half. She was home on Tuesday,
the 16th, is that right&mdash;skipped a day, the 22d. So that his party was the
week before, too. I was wrong then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did he return, on Friday of that week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, which was the 25th. I was mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he call in each day in the interim?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And talk to Marina and to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Inquire about the baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You overheard some of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said about the nature of his reaction to his position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
at the Texas School Book Depository on the second weekend when he
came home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You are talking about the weekend of the 26th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't recall anything being said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the next weekend was November 1st to 3d, which is Friday
to Sunday, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he home on that weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did anything eventful occur on that weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just a minute. What I was looking for, I wanted to find out
whether I had taught a Russian lesson to my single student whom I saw some
Saturday afternoon on that weekend, and I recall that I did not. So, the
answer is no. I was there that Saturday. May I say if there was a weekend
other than October 12 when he came on Saturday instead of Friday night, it
was to have been that weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The weekend of the 1st to the 3d. That is my best recollection
anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. But other than that possibility, there was nothing&mdash;it
was a normal weekend at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, following that weekend, which was the weekend of November
8 through 10, I think you have already described that weekend. That
was the one on which you went to the Texas driver's application bureau, is
it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I recall him writing something on the early morning of Saturday&mdash;this
"Dear Sirs" letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; this is the letter or draft of letter dealing with his reporting
his visit to Mexico.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or stating that he had done such a thing, which I did not fully
credit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he come the following weekend, that is the weekend of
November 15 through 17?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina asked him not to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was the weekend preceding the ill-fated assassination day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did she ask him not to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She felt he had overstayed his welcome the previous weekend
which had been 3 days, 9th, 10th, and 11th because he was off Veterans Day,
the 11th of November, and she felt it would be simpler and more comfortable if
he didn't come out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had a discussion with her prior to that time on that
subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had not suggested that to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you overhear her tell him that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did tell her I was planning a birthday party for my little girl,
and I heard her tell Lee not to come out because I was having a birthday party.
At some point in this same telephone conversation likely I told him he did not
need to have a car but to go himself to the driver training station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have described that event for us heretofore this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or this morning, I have forgotten which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I interrupt here. I wonder whether or not you would
want to take a rest now. We have been pretty arduous and let's take a little
recess now.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Reporter, would you read the last interchange or question
and answer?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
(The reporter read the question and answer.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you fix as best you can for us, the date or time that you
first saw the wrapped blanket after you had returned to Irving? How long after
that event did you see it to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have said it was the latter part of October. I don't think I can
fix it more exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be almost or would be over a month afterwards?
You returned on September 24?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall thinking, that is, that anything like that marks it as
being particular noticeable. So that I am judging that I recall seeing it in
October, somewhere towards the end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had anything occurred at that time that now leads you to fix
it at the latter part of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; there is no way that I have to fix it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you stumble over it or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Could it have been as early as October 4 or the 7th when you
first got the call from him when he first returned to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Conceivably, but I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Then you saw it on another occasion, how many days later was
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't fix it that near.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It was several days later, was it, the time when it seemed to
have been moved from position "X" to position "XX"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes; that was later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Can you place it at all, can you place your recollection at all
as having seen it in relation to the assassination? The date of the assassination?
Was it 2 weeks before, 3 weeks before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have inquired of myself for some weeks, was such a package
in my station wagon when I arrived from New Orleans, and I cannot recall it, but
I cannot be at all certain that there wasn't. I certainly didn't unload it. I never
lifted such a package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Only you and Marina took things out of your station wagon at that
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So I think I would have seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In your earlier testimony I think in reply to a question, you
indicated that you and Marina had only talked about this after the assassination
that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. If it is not out of order, I would like to get that into the testimony
maybe at this date what took place between them at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I think it is best to leave it at the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was going to take her chronologically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just so you recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But you can't recall having gone into the garage for any purpose
and having stepped over this thing or around it at any time that you would
associate with his return from New Orleans and Houston, if he went to Houston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is that it was after, it was in October,
therefore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But later than the 7th of October, you think?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Later than that, yes. That is the best I can do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But well before the day of November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think I have oriented myself without having the reporter read
and may I proceed, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have now reached the weekend of the 15th, 16th, and 17th,
which is the weekend that Lee Harvey Oswald did not return to your home.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had just finished relating that Marina had told him not to
come that particular weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was there an occasion during the course of that weekend
when a phone call was made to Lee Harvey Oswald. I direct your attention
particularly to Sunday evening, the 17th of November.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Looking back on it, I thought that there was a call made to him
by me on Monday the 18th, but I may be wrong about when it was made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina call him this Sunday evening, November 17?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. There was only one call made at any one time to him, to my
knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall an occasion when a call was made to him and you
girls were unable to reach him when that call was made?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I will describe the call, and there is a dispute over what
night it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like your best recollection, first as to when it occurred.
Was it during the weekend that he did not return to your home, the weekend
immediately preceding the assassination day? Do you recall that Marina was
lonesome and she wished you to make a call to Lee and you did so at her request?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall certainly we had talked with Lee, on the telephone already
that weekend because he called to say that he had been to attempt to get a
driver's license permit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Whether he called that Saturday or whether he had called Sunday,
I am not certain. Indeed, I am not certain but what he had called the very
day, had already called and talked with Marina the very day that I then, at her
request, tried to reach him at the number he had given me, with his number
in my telephone book.</p>

<p>Junie was fooling with the telephone dial, and Marina said, "Let's call papa"
and asked <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this at night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was early evening, still light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it on a weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would have said it was Monday but I am not certain of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my best recollection, is that it was Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All we want is your best recollection. If it was a Monday, was
it the Monday following the weekend that he did not come?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, certainly it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. That is if it was a Monday, it was the Monday preceding
November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was there any evidence that the hint you gave, or that was given,
to Lee Harvey not to come over this weekend caused him any annoyance? Was
he put out by this, and did he indicate it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I made no such request of him. Marina talked with him on the
phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I realize that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And she made no mention of any irritation. Of course, I didn't
hear what he said in response to her asking him not to come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And it didn't come out in any of these subsequent telephone messages
which we are now discussing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I think I probably talked with him during that same telephone
conversation to say that he could go without a car, and there was no
irritation I noticed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it is your definite recollection that his failure to come on the
weekend preceding the assassination was not at his doing but at the request of
Marina, under the circumstances you have related?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am absolutely clear about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are absolutely clear about that. All right. Now, state, you
began to state the circumstances of the telephone call. Would you in your own
words and your own chronology proceed with that, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina had said, "Let's call papa," in Russian and asked me to
dial the number for her, knowing that I had a number that he had given us. I
then dialed the <span class="locked">number&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, did you dial the first or the second number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The second number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that number is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. WH 3-8993.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you dialed the number did someone answer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Someone answered and I said, "Is Lee Oswald there?" And the
person replied, "There is no Lee Oswald here," or something to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it refresh your recollection if he said, "There is nobody
by that name here"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or it may have been "nobody by that name" or "I don't know Lee
Oswald." It could have been any of these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We want your best recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is that he repeated the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He repeated the name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But that is not a certain recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it then from the use of the pronoun that the person who
answered was a man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Was a man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And if you will just sit back and relax a little. I would like to
have you restate, if you now will, in your own words, what occurred?</p>

<p>You dialed the telephone, someone answered, a male voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say and what did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said, "Is Lee Oswald there." He said, "There is no Lee Oswald
living here." As best as I can recall. This is the substance of what he said.
I said, "Is this a rooming house." He said "Yes." I said, "Is this WH 3-8993?"
And he said "Yes." I thanked him and hung up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you hung up then what did you next do or say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said to Marina, "They don't know of a Lee Oswald at that
number."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She didn't say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just said nothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She looked surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she evidence any surprise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she did, she looked surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are quite sure you used the first name "Lee," did you, you did
not say just "Mr. Oswald," or something of that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would not say "Mr. Oswald." It is contrary to Quaker practice,
and I don't normally do it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Contrary to Quaker practice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They seldom use "Mister."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And you wouldn't have said "Harvey Oswald," would you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I knew he had a middle name but only because I filled out forms
in Parkland Hospital. It was never used with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do recall definitely that you asked for Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I cannot be that definite. But I believe I asked for him. Oh,
yes; I recall definitely what I asked. I cannot be definite about the man's reply,
whether he included the full name in his reply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I asked for the full name, "Is Lee Oswald there."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you report this incident to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no occasion to see them, and I did not think it important
enough to call them after that until the 23d of November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Perhaps I may well have deferred that question until after I asked
you the next.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any event occur the following day with respect to this telephone
call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; Lee <span class="locked">called&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Lee called at the house and asked for Marina. I was in the
kitchen where the phone is while Marina talked with him, she clearly was upset,
and angry, and when she hung <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, did you overhear this conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I overheard the conversation but I can't tell you specific content.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, Mrs. Paine, would you do your very best to recall what
was said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can tell you what she said to me which was immediately after,
which is what I definitely recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said immediately he didn't like her trying to reach him at
the phone in his room at Dallas yesterday. That he was angry with her for
having tried to reach him. That he said he was using a different name, and
she said, "This isn't the first time I felt 22 fires," a Russian expression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is something she said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said this. This is not the first time, but it was the first time
she had mentioned it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give her exact words to me again.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When she felt 22 fires.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the expression she used?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you understand what she meant or, if not, did you ask for an
explanation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not ask for an explanation. I judged she meant, she disagreed
with his using a different name, but didn't feel like, empowered to make
him do otherwise or even perhaps ask to as a wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How long a conversation was this. Was <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Fairly short.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Fairly short.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What day of the month and what day of the week was
this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, reconstructing it, I thought they succeeded each other,
the original call to the WH number on Monday and his call back on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When he called back it was late in the afternoon or
early evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was the normal time for him to call back, early evening,
around 5:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a definite impression she was angry when she hung up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she abrupt in her hanging up. Did she hang up on him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she was angry, she was upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her explanation of her being upset was that he used the
assumed name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, she didn't explain it as such, but she said he had used it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was angry with her because you had made the call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or she had made it through you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any further discussion take place between you and Marina
on that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. The following day he did not call at the usual time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be the following day, the 20th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe that was a Wednesday and that is how I slipped a day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't call at all on the succeeding day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He didn't call at all, and she said to me as the time for normally
calling passed, "He thinks he is punishing me."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For having been a bad wife, I would judge, for having done something
he didn't want her to do, the objection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To wit, the telephone call about which you have told us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and Marina go through a normal day that day, or was
there any other subject of discussion with respect to Lee Oswald on that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing I would specifically recall; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was the 20th of November, a Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's proceed with the 21st. Did anything occur on the 21st
with respect to Lee Harvey Oswald, that is a Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I arrived home from grocery shopping around 5:30, and he was
on the front lawn. I was surprised to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had no advance notice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no advance notice and he had never before come without
asking whether he could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Never before had he come to your home in that form without
asking your permission to come?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Without asking permission; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was out on the lawn as you drove up, on your lawn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. Playing with June and talking with Marina, who
was also out on the lawn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were, of course, surprised to see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you park your car in the driveway as usual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you walk over to speak with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, got out, very likely picked some groceries out of the car
and he very likely picked some up too, and this is I judge what may have
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell the Commission what was said between you and Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Between me and Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is not what I recall. I recall talking with Marina on the
side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. First. Didn't you greet him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I greeted him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then what did you do, walk in the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As we were walking in the house, and he must have preceded
because Marina and I spoke in private to one another, she apologized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina out on the lawn also?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, sir. She apologized for his having come without permission
and I said that was all right, and we said either then or later&mdash;I recall exchanging
our opinion that this was a way of making up the quarrel or as close
as he could come to an apology for the fight on the telephone, that his coming
related to that, rather than anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was her reaction to his showing up uninvited and unexpectedly
on that particular afternoon, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it was rather my own, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was your own?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And because of this incident of the telephone call and your not
being able to reach him, and the subsequent talk between Lee and Marina in
which there had been some anger expressed, you girls reached the conclusion
the afternoon of November 21 that he was home just to see if he could make up
with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do I fairly state it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do that evening? Did you have occasion to note
what he did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We had dinner as usual, and then I sort of bathed my children,
putting them to bed and reading them a story, which put me in one part of the
house. When that was done I realized he had already gone to bed, this being
now about 9 o'clock. I went out to the garage to paint some children's blocks,
and worked in the garage for half an hour or so. I noticed when I went out
that the light was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The light was on in the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The light was on in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this unusual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, it was unusual for it to be on; yes. I realized that I felt
Lee, since Marina had also been busy with her children, had gone out to the
garage, perhaps worked out there or gotten something. Most of their clothing
was still out there, all of their winter things. They were getting things out
from time to time, warmer things for the cold weather, so it was not at all
remarkable that he went to the garage, but I thought it careless of him to have
left the light on. I finished my work and then turned off the light and left the
garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you completed that now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You stated that he was in the garage, how did you know he was
in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. She didn't state that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't state it absolutely. I guessed it was he rather than
she. She was busy with the children and the light had been on and I know I
didn't leave the light on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, I would ask you directly, did you see him in the garage
at anytime from the time you first saw him on the lawn until he retired for
the night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Until you retired for the night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he out on the lawn after dinner or supper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear any activity out in the garage on that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any persons moving about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The only thing that arrested your attention was the fact that
you discovered the light on in the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before you retired?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You discovered that when you went out to work there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I went out to work there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you went out there, did you notice the blanket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically seeing the blanket. I certainly recall
on the afternoon of the 22d where it had been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was there any evidence of any quarreling or any harsh words
between Lee Harvey and Marina that evening that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a coolness between them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He went to bed very early, she stayed up and talked with me
some, but there was no coolness that I noticed. He was quite friendly on the
lawn as <span class="locked">we&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean coolness between himself and&mdash;between Lee and Marina.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't notice any such coolness. Rather, they seemed warm,
like a couple making up a small spat, I should interject one thing here, too,
that I recall as I entered the house and Lee had just come in, I said to him,
"Our President is coming to town."</p>

<p>And he said, "Ah, yes," and walked on into the kitchen, which was a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
reply from him on anything. I was just excited about this happening, and
there was his response. Nothing more was said about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I didn't quite catch his answer.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "Ah, yes," a very common answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He gave no more than that laconic answer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had there been any discussion between you and Marina that
the President was coming into town the next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything on that subject in the presence of Lee
that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall anything of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What time did you have dinner that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 6 or 6:30, I would guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And calling on your recollection, Mrs. Paine, following dinner
do you remember any occasion that evening when Lee was out of the house
and you didn't see him around the house, and you were conscious of the fact
he was not in the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was not at anytime of the opinion that he was out of the house,
conscious of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no recollection of his being out of the house anytime
that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he do any reading that evening&mdash;books, papers, anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were you doing that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have tried already to describe that after dinner, and probably
after some dishes were done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who did the dishes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very likely Marina, it depended on who made the meal. I
normally cooked the meal and then she did the dishes or we reversed occasionally.
But I have tried to say I was very likely involved in the back bedroom
and in the bathroom giving the children a bath, getting them in their pajamas
and reading a story for as much as an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would take as much as an hour?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That takes as much as an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By this time we are up to approximately 7:30 or 8 o'clock,
are we?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh no; we are up to nearly 9 o'clock by now. We eat from 6:30
to after 7, do some dishes, brings it up toward 8, and then put the children to
bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you had had your children put to bed and came out of
their room, was Lee, had he then by that time retired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you have any words with Marina about the light in the
garage? Was that a subject of conversation between you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; we didn't discuss it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You didn't mention it to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't discuss it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he ever help in the kitchen at all, in any way
whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I have said he once did dishes in New Orleans, but that
is about all I recall that he did.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But in Dallas, in your home, he never volunteered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Marina did help around the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She helped a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. She was a good helper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She is a hard worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us, the time you came out of the bedroom and put your
children to bed when you noticed the light in the garage; fix as well as you
can the time of evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was about 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is when you noticed the light in the garage, around 9
o'clock after you put your children to bed, and at that time Lee was already
retired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina was still up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did she remain up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall that evening from that point on much like any
others, with the two of us up, we probably folded some diapers, laundry. Some
evening close to that time, either that evening or the one before, we discussed
plans for Christmas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. But it was probably the evening before. I was thinking
about making a playhouse for the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe Lee's attire when you first saw him on the
lawn when you returned that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no recollection of that? Did he bring&mdash;do you know
whether he brought anything with him in the way of paper or wrapper or
luggage or this sticky tape, anything of that nature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall seeing anything of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see any paper, wrapping paper, of the character that you
have identified around your home that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Can't you recall a little more clearly how he generally was
dressed? Did he have a coat on such as I have got on now, or did he <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never saw him in a suit jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Suit jacket? What was his normal outer wear apparel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His normal attire was T-shirt, cotton slacks, sometimes the
T-shirt covered by a shirt, flannel or cotton shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you recall whether he had that type of shirt over his T-shirt
that night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You don't recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have any kind of a shirt other than a T-shirt on him
when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't really remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wonder, Mr. Chairman, if despite the fact I haven't reached
the next day, if we might excuse Mrs. Paine? She did tell me she had an
appointment at 5:30 this evening, and I would like to have her think over more
so she can be refreshed in the morning as to this particular evening. And,
Mrs. Paine, I would have you trace the first thing in the morning as best as you
can recall Lee Harvey Oswald's movements that evening and where he was,
to the best that you are able to recall. Would you try to do that for us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I probably have done the best I can, but I will do it again
if you like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May we have permission to adjourn, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask just one question? With regard to this sketch
of the house, I was interested to know where you would see the light in the
garage. Was it from out here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is a doorway into the garage from the kitchen area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And you saw that light from the kitchen area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I was probably on my way to the garage anyway, opened
the door, there was the light on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see. There are no windows or anything. The door was closed
and the light would not be visible if you hadn't gone into it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It would be visible if it was dark in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I understand. Through the door.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you spent about a half hour in the garage painting
some blocks?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What part of the <span class="locked">garage&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Close to the doorway here, the entrance, this entrance.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The entrance going into <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The doorway between the garage and the kitchen-dining area.
Right here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You didn't move around the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I moved around enough to get some shellac and brush and make
a place, a block is this big, to paint.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where do you recollect, if you do, the blanket was at
this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recollect. It was the next <span class="locked">day&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It was the forepart of the garage on the left-hand side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Beyond.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Does anyone have any further questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Representative Ford has directed the attention of the witness to the document
which is now Exhibit No. 430, and when we reconvene in the morning I will
qualify the exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Is that all?</p>

<p>We will reconvene at 9 a.m., tomorrow.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 5:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 9:05 a.m. on Friday, March 20, 1964, at
200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman
Cooper, Representative Gerald R. Ford, and John J. McCloy, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Albert E. Jenner, Jr.,
assistant counsel; and Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel.</p>

<p class="p2">Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Mrs. Paine, you, I think, yesterday affirmed, made affirmation
as to the truthfulness of your testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You are still under that affirmation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I understand that I am under that affirmation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I proceed?</p>

<p>Thank you. Mrs. Paine, just to put you at ease this morning, Mr. Chairman,
may I qualify some documents?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Good morning, gentlemen and ladies. How are you, Mrs.
Paine? I am glad to see you this morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, I show you Commission Exhibit No. 425 which you
produced and which you testified was the original of a letter of October 14, 1963,
to your mother, part of which you read at large in the record. Is that document
in your handwriting entirely?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You testified it is a letter from you to your mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you dispatch the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In view of that fact would you explain for the record how you
came into possession of the letter since you sent it to your mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She gave it to me a few days ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the document now in the same condition it was when you
mailed it to your mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is. You have the first page of two. The other page not
being relative to this case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, that there be no question about it, do you have
the other page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have the other page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I have it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The other page, of course, contains my signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. May the record be amended to show that Commission Exhibit
No. &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I'd rather not have that part of <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is not going into the record, Mrs. Paine. Just be patient.
Commission Exhibit 425 consists of two pages, that is two sheets. The pages are
numbered from one through four. Would you look at the page numbered 4?
There is a signature appearing at the bottom of it. Is that your signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I postpone the offer of this document in
evidence until I do read the second page, which the witness has now produced.
You see, Mrs. Paine, that it may be important to the Commission to have the
entire letter which would indicate the context in which the statements that are
relevant were made.</p>

<p>You testified yesterday with regard to the draft of what appeared to be a
letter that Mr. Oswald, Lee Harvey Oswald, was to send. It was thought he
might send it to someone. I hand you a picture of a letter in longhand which
has been identified as Commission Exhibit 103. Would you look at that please?
Do you recognize that handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. This is the only time I saw&mdash;this is the only handwriting
of his I have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You can't identify the document as such, that is, are you familiar
enough with his <span class="locked">handwriting&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To know that this is his handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To identify whether that is or is not his handwriting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever seen that Document before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first see it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I first saw that on Saturday, the 9th of November. I don't
believe I looked to see what it said until the morning of the 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Now, do you recognize it, however, as a picture of the
document that you did see on the 9th of November, or did you say 10th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I'll say 10th, yes; it is that document.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What is the answer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is that document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I take it from your testimony that after you had seen the
original of this document, this document happens to be a photo, you saw a
typed transcript of this document or substantially this document?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never saw a typed transcript.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, you testified yesterday that Lee Harvey Oswald
asked you if he could use your typewriter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he did proceed to use the typewriter to type a letter or at
least some document?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that you saw a document folded in half and one portion
of it arrested your attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the document that arrested your attention the typed document
or was it the document that is before you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never saw the typed document. It was the document that is
before me, which I take to be a rough draft of what he typed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you said you made a duplicate of the document. Did you
make a duplicate in longhand or on your typewriter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I made a duplicate in longhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have a present recollection that this, Commission
Exhibit No. 103 for identification, is the document which you saw in your home
on your desk secretary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No.
103 the document&mdash;oh, it is already in evidence. I withdraw that offer.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. It is in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Redlich informs me, Mr. Chairman, that the document has
already been admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>Now, would you follow me as I go through these? There has been marked
as Commission's Exhibit 430, which is the mark at the moment for identification,
what purports to be a floor plan outline of the Paine home at 2515 Fifth
Street, Irving, Tex., and the witness made reference to that yesterday close to
the close of her testimony yesterday afternoon. Directing your attention to
that exhibit, is that an accurate floor plan outline of your home at 2515 Fifth
Street, Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is an approximately accurate floor plan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it properly entitled, that is, are the rooms and sections
of the home properly entitled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does it accurately reflect the door openings, the hallways
in your home and the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is perfectly accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think one thing only needs some explanation. In the upper
left-hand corner of the floor plan outline, there is a square space which has
no lettering to identify that space. It is the area immediately to the left of
the&mdash;of what is designated as kitchen-dining area.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. That space is all one room with that which is designated
kitchen-dining area. That is one large room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. So that even though on the floor plan outline the words
"kitchen-dining area" appear in the right half of that space, that lettering and
wording is to apply to all the space?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the driveway about which you testified is that portion of
the ground outline which has the circle with the figure "8" and an arrow, is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the driveway is where the car was parked because the
garage always had too many things in it to get your car in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Referring to Commission Exhibit No. 431 for identification, is
that a front view of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you present when the picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit 432, is that a rear view of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you present when that was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But that is an accurate depiction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the rear of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is certainly accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And showing some of your yard. The next Exhibit 433, is that
a view of the east side of your home?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. East and north; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were you present when that was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wouldn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it is an accurate depiction of that area of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit 434, is that a view of the west side of your
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. West and north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you present when that was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Despite that, is it accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is perfectly accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, is Commission Exhibit 435 a view inside your home looking
through the door leading to the garage from your kitchen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were you present when that was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit 436, is that a picture of the doorway area
leading to the backyard of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you present when that was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit 437, is that the kitchen area in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, were you present when that was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Returning now to the floor plan exhibit, Commission Exhibit
430, is Commission Exhibit 437, which is the kitchen area in your home, that
portion of Commission Exhibit 430 which is lettered "kitchen-dining area."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a picture of that portion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of that portion, rather than the portion to the left which is
unlettered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The garage interior we identified yesterday. By the way,
have you ever been in the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you been there often enough to identify a floor plan and
pictures of the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I have been there perhaps once or twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you intend to call Mrs. Randle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Unfortunately Mrs. Randle has already testified and Mr. Ball
when he questioned her did not have this exhibit. It wasn't in existence.</p>

<p>I show you a page marked Commission Exhibit No. 441 entitled "Randle
Home, 2439 West Fifth Street, Irving, Tex.," purporting to be a floor plan
outline of the Randle home. You have been in the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On several occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two or three; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And are you familiar with the general area of the Randle
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Surrounding the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And looking at Commission Exhibit 441, is that an accurate
floor plan outline and general community outline of the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I would say it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I show you Commission Exhibit 442. Is that an accurate and
true and correct photograph showing the corner view of the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 443, is that an accurate photograph of a portion of the
kitchen portion, the front of the kitchen window of the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does your recollection serve <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am trying to see if I know which is west and north there and
I am not certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let us return to the floor plan.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This would be, yes, that is what I thought. This is looking
then west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have now oriented yourself. And is it an accurate picture
of the front of the kitchen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Which exhibit are you referring to now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The front of the Randle home No. 443. The next number, 444,
is that an accurate photograph of the area of the Randle home showing a
view from the field from the Randle's kitchen window?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Across the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit 445, is that an accurate photograph of
the kitchen of the Randle home looking at the direction of the carport from
the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is an accurate picture showing the door opening to the
carport; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the kitchen portion of the Randle home facing on the
carport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever been in the carport area of the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is Commission Exhibit 446 a view of a portion of the
carport area of the Randle home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It looks like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now 447 is a photograph taken from the street looking toward
the Randle home, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is the west side of the Randle house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Showing that carport area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is accurate, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit 438, is that an accurate photograph of the
area of Irving Street showing not only the Randle house but also your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is Commission Exhibit <span class="locked">448&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What was the number of the photograph which you just
referred to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 438. 438 is view looking northeast showing the Paine home at
the left and the Randle home at the far right. Directing your attention to
Commission Exhibit 448, is that an accurate photograph showing a view of the
Randle home looking West Fifth Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Commission Exhibit 438 an accurate photograph showing a
view looking west along Fifth Street to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is the arrow that appears on that photograph&mdash;does that
point to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Commission Exhibit No. 450, which I now show you, an accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
photograph of the intersection of Westbrook Drive and West Fifth Street
viewed from immediately outside the Randle kitchen window?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It looks to be exactly that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I now show you Commission Exhibit No. 440 entitled "Paine and
Randle homes, Irving, Tex." which purports to be, and I believe is, a scale drawing
of the area in Irving, Tex., along West Fifth Street and Westbrook Drive,
in which your home at 2515 West Fifth Street is shown in outline, and the location
and form of the Randle home down the street and on the corner is likewise
shown.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is accurate.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Are you going to make part of the record these exhibits
which she has identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I am about to offer these and I would ask Mr. Redlich if
he would assemble the exhibit numbers so I can make the offer, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine, now that you have had a rest over night, we would like to return
to the late afternoon and the evening of November 21. Did Lee Harvey Oswald
come to Irving, Tex., at anytime that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He came some time shortly before 5:30 in the evening on the 21st.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had either you or Marina, I limit it to you first, had you had any
notice or intimation whatsoever that Lee Harvey Oswald would appear on that
day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his appearance was a complete surprise to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anything occur during the day or during that week up to
the time that you saw Lee Harvey Oswald that afternoon that impressed you or
led you to believe that Marina had any notion whatsoever that her husband
would or might appear at your home on that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing. I rather had the contrary impressions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what was your first notice, what was the circumstances that
brought your attention to the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was in Irving, Tex.,
that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I arrived home from the grocery store in my car and saw he was
on the front lawn at my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had had no word whatsoever from anybody prior to that
moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No word whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now where was he? And we may use the exhibits we have just
identified. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence the photographs and the floor
plans and the area outlines the witness has just identified and testified about
as they are Commission Exhibit Nos. 429 through 448 both inclusive, and 450 and
452.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The exhibits offered will be received in evidence.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibits Nos. 429 through 448 both inclusive, and 450 and 452
were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Senator Cooper, at this time I am obliged to leave for our
all-day conference on Friday at the Supreme Court, and I may be back later in
the day, but if I don't, you continue, of course.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I will this morning. If I can't be here this afternoon, whom
do you want to preside?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford, would you be here this afternoon at all?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Unfortunately Mr. McCloy and I have to go to a conference
out of town.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You are both going out of town, aren't you?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I can go and come back if it is necessary.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I will try to be here myself. Will Mr. Dulles be here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. He is out of town.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. If you should not finish, Mr. Jenner, will you phone me at the
Court and I will try to suspend my own conference over there and come over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I will be here anyway all morning and will try to come back
this afternoon.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much. Mrs. Paine, I want to thank you for
coming and for being so patient with our long questioning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am glad to do what I can.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You know that it is necessary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You might use the ruler, and I have set the floor plan and the
area plan of your home, Mrs. Paine, Exhibit 430, on the blackboard. As you
testify, it might be helpful to point to those areas. Now in which direction were
you coming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was coming from the east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the east?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Along West Fifth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were going west. Your home is on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first sight, where were you when you first saw
Lee in your courtyard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just past the corner of Westbrook and Fifth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That area is open from that point to your home; is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The area of the front yard; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your home is well set back from the street or sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Moderately set back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What would you judge that distance to be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two car lengths from the opening of the garage to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now where was Lee Oswald when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was on the grass just to the east of the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Near the driveway just to the east, but he was out in front of
your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do then? You proceeded down the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I parked my car, yes; parked my car in its usual position in the
driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your driveway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up close to the garage opening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that left you then, you were on the left side or the driving
side of your automobile. You got out, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which way? Did you get out to your left or did you swing across
the seat and get out at the right hand door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I got out on the driver's side, on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then what did you do? First tell us what you did. Did you
go into your home directly? Did you walk around?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I greeted Lee and Marina, who were both on the front lawn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was their daughter June out in front as well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Their daughter June was out in front. It was warm. Lee was
playing with June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How was he attired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said that he normally wore a T-shirt.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he in a T-shirt or shirt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I'd be fairly certain he didn't have a jacket on, but that whatever
it was was tucked in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember the color of his trousers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now at that point you were surprised to see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say to him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do recall greeting him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't recall that you evidenced any surprise that he was
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had there ever been an occasion prior thereto that he had
appeared at your home without prior notice to you and permission from you for
him to appear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There had been no such occasion. He had always asked permission
prior to coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there never had been an exception to that up to this moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No exception.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May we have the time again? You say it was late in the afternoon,
but can you fix the time a little more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was getting on toward 5:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you tarry and talk with Lee and Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I remember only that Marina and I were still on the grass at
the entryway to the house when she spoke of her embarrassment to me in an
aside, that is to say, not in Lee's hearing, that she was sorry he hadn't called
ahead and asked if that was all right. And I said "Why, that is all right."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing was said by her as to why he had come out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And nothing <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was clearly surprised also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. You made no inquiry of her I take it then of any explanation
made by Lee Oswald as to why he had come out unannounced and
unexpectedly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least not as of that moment.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now when you had your aside with Marina, where was Lee
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the grass near the tree playing with June as closely as I can
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did you and Marina remain in conversation at that
place, position?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Less than a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can only reconstruct it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all I am asking you to do.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I must have gotten groceries from the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean reconstruct in the sense of rationalizing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish you would give me first your recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am certain of going into the house, and I recall standing just
inside the doorway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But inside the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But inside now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which way were you facing when you were standing inside the
doorway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was facing partly toward the door, toward the loud speaker.
I was facing this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why were you facing outwardly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe I turned. I was coming in. I believe I turned to speak
to Lee as he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee followed you in the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did Marina come in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall whether she was already in or still out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have a recollection that Lee followed you into your
home.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I recall very clearly the position I was in in the room and
the position he was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was turned part way toward the door. He was coming in,
having just entered the door and in front of this loud speaker to which I refer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the loud speaker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The loud speaker is part of the Hi-Fi set. It stands&mdash;it is a big
thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did something occur at that moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And it was at that time that I said to him "Our President is
coming to town." I believe I said it in Russian, our President is coming to
town in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you gave us his response yesterday but you might do it
again.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said "Uh, yeah" and brushed on by me, walked on past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have an attitude of indifference?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was clearly both indifference and not wanting to go on and
talk, because he moved away from me on into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He went into your kitchen. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are anxious to follow minute by minute, to the extent possible,
all the movements of which you had any knowledge of Lee Oswald on
this late afternoon and throughout the evening. Did Lee Oswald remain in
your presence right at this time when you entered the house? If so, how long?
You had this short conversation. Did he leave your presence then and go to
some other part of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He might have gone to some other part of the home. He didn't
leave the house to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I didn't mean to imply that, only whether he remained in the
general area in which you were in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he pass from your sight?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before you guess about it, give us your best recollection.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Tell what you remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes; just in your own words tell us what your best recollection
of this afternoon was without second to second sequence.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Clearly just having come from the grocery store I put the bags
down in the kitchen and unpacked them, put them away, started supper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any sense that Lee Oswald was in and about the
inside of the house while you were doing this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection that he did not go out into the yard
during this period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall. If he did, it would have been the back. It would
have been unusual for him to go in the front yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now you were preparing your dinner in your kitchen, were you
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does the entrance to your garage&mdash;is there an entrance to
your garage opening from your kitchen into the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is an entrance to the garage from the kitchen; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And one of the exhibits we qualified this morning is a picture of
that area of your home, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your answer was yes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At anytime while you were preparing dinner was Lee Oswald in
the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were aware of that fact, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my best recollection that he was not in the garage while
I was preparing dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know where he was while you were preparing dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion to look into your garage area at anytime
during the period you were preparing dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was Marina during the period you were preparing dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I'd have to guess.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Just tell what you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell what you know first.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection with respect to whether she was
inside the house or outside the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall that she was inside the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where was the child June with respect to whether she was
inside or outside the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having located Marina and the Oswald daughter inside your
home, does that refresh your recollection as to whether Lee was also inside the
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As far as I remember, he was also inside the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he playing with his daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did it take you to prepare dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably half an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am unaware of the shades of evening and night in Texas. By
the time you had completed dinner had night fallen or was it still light?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What time does nightfall come in Texas in November, late
November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say between 7 and 7:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I shouldn't have been as broad as I was. I meant to locate it
in Irving, Tex., rather than Texas generally. About 7:30?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Between 7 and 7:30. I don't know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you sit down for dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I suppose around 6:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it still light outside, natural light?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee Oswald join you for dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long did dinner take?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Perhaps half an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he remain in your presence during all of the dinner period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Either there or in the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At anytime during the dinner period, did Lee Oswald leave your
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a firm recollection of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At anytime during that period did Lee Oswald enter the garage
area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The deepfreeze is in the garage. I don't recall having gone, but
I go all the time for goods for the baby, for my little boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you use anything from the deepfreeze normally, in connection
with the preparation of an evening meal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I could have gone out then too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Though you don't recall it specifically, it is possible that you went
into the garage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Garage area.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But you don't remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember. This is something I do as habit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is so much habit that you don't single it out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, if you entered the garage, it was pursuant to a
normal practice of preparing dinner and not because you were seeking to look
for something out of the ordinary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or that your attention was arrested by something out of the
ordinary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After the dinner hour or half hour, whatever it took, what did
you do? Let's take say the 1-hour period following your dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was busy putting my children to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where were you located during that period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I normally read them a story in the bedroom which is the back
bedroom on the north side.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you do it that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Not normally but do you remember that you did it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am certain I read them a story.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am certain I read them a story. Whether they also had a bath
that night I can't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now being in your children's bedroom, which I take it was also
your <span class="locked">bedroom&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be the rear portion of your home at the corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you were in that room, what can you see with respect to
other portions of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The view from the bedroom door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Looking into what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Looking west looks into the kitchen-dining area right past the
doorway entrance to the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you see into the living room area of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From that doorway you can; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you stand in the doorway, I take it you can do so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But sitting on the bed reading a story; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But if you stood in the middle of the room and looked out that
doorway from your bedroom, you would look into the kitchen area, not into the
living room area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did you remain in your bedroom putting your children
to bed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That process can take as much as an hour and often does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give us your very best recollection of how long it took this
evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically how long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your recollection that you pursued your normal course in
getting them to bed. You read a story, I take it, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you undressed the children and placed them in the crib or
bed and you say that normally takes approximately an hour?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you remained in the bedroom during all of that 1 hour
period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I wouldn't be certain of that; no. I also prepare a bottle
which involves going to the kitchen, and heating milk. I also chase my children.
They don't always just stay in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see Lee Harvey Oswald either in or about your home
from time to time during this hour period that you were preparing your children
for sleep that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically except that I was aware he was in the
home.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How would you be aware he was in the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would have noticed it if he had gone out the door it seems to
me, out the front door. One can easily hear, and that would be an unusual
thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why would it be unusual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, he never did go out the front door in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Once he entered your home his normal practice was to stay
inside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Was to turn on the television set and sit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he turn on the television set?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe he watched television that evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you tell us of any awareness on your part of his presence
in the home, that is you were definitely conscious that he remained inside the
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was not out in the yard?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How would you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a small house. You can hear if the front door or the back
door opens. But I can't be absolutely certain.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is what you are saying that you don't remember, or rather
that you don't remember that the front door or the back door did open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. I am also saying there is very little about that
evening that stood out as unusual. I have tried to say what I could think of
that did stand out as unusual. I think the rest melds together with other
evenings which were similar.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I don't want to interrupt you but I think she has got to tell
what she remembers that evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes. I think without the meticulous minute by minute, just say
what it is.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. If you don't remember, you don't remember.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You can't break it down into sequence that far back?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Just tell what you remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead and tell us, Mrs. Paine, the course of events that evening,
with particular reference to what we are interested in, what Lee Oswald did
and where he was during the course of that evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have already said that after I had my children in bed, I went
to the garage to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it now nighttime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was now dark, I recall about 9 o'clock. I noticed that the
light was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the door to the garage open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it was closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was closed. And you noticed the light on when you opened
the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had the light been on at anytime to your knowledge prior to
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not that evening; no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When entering and leaving the garage during the course of your
preparing dinner, to your recollection, was there any light on at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't turn the light on at anytime up to this moment of
which you speak?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Had you been in the garage that evening before the time
that you found the light on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If I had only in this course of habit which also included if it was
dark, flipping the switch on and flipping it off.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You don't remember if you did that or not before.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Specifically, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. She said she might have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a hand switch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You must trip it. Where is the switch located, in the kitchen or
in the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The switch is in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, the witness has before her Commission Exhibit
435, which is a picture of her home, looking through the door leading to the
garage from the kitchen. Is the light switch shown in that picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And why is it not shown?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The light switch that turns on the light in the garage is on the
interior of the garage approximately through the wall from the switch you
see in the picture, which lights the kitchen, or the dining area overhead light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the switch that is shown in the picture, is it to the right of
the doorjamb?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And rather high?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Placed high, and on the picture it is shown as having, oh, is
that a white plastic plate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the switch that lights the garage light is directly opposite
on the other side of the wall inside the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now directing your attention to Commission Exhibit 429, that
is a picture, is it not, of the garage interior of your home taken from the outlet
door of the garage and looking back toward the kitchen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct? And does that show the doorway from the
garage into your kitchen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, the opposite side of the wall, which is shown
in Commission Exhibit 435?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And are you able to locate the light switch on Commission Exhibit
429 which is the garage interior exhibit? That is, can you see the switch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I am not certain I can. This is something else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I point out to you the configuration which is halfway down the
garage doorjamb outline.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right next to the top surface of the deepfreeze.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Is that the light switch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought it was higher.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You know there is a light switch there, don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. There is a light switch there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I know I don't pull the string which is there clearly in the
picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You step down into the garage do you, or is it at the kitchen
floor level?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Are you still asking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; you don't step down, perhaps 3 inches all together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The floor of the garage and the floor of the kitchen are at a level?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Approximately at a level.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you enter the garage on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was about to lacquer some children's large blocks, playing
blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These are blocks that you had cut at some other time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had cut them on the saw in the garage; yes; previously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Proceed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Jenner, may I ask a question there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Some people have a habit of turning lights on and off
again regularly. Others are a little careless about it. Would you describe your
attitude in this regard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am definitely a person with the habit of turning them off.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is a trait that you have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Now, if you were to go out from the kitchen to the garage,
is it easy for you as you go out the door to turn the light on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And off; yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is very simple for you to do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Both going out and coming in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And as you go out on your right or left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is on my left as I go out of the garage.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And as you come in from the garage to the kitchen it is
on your right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As you come into the garage from the <span class="locked">kitchen&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you are going out to the garage, on which side is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is on my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. On your right. Coming out from the garage to the kitchen it
is on your left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You said it just the opposite, I think.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I thought I asked the question and she responded in the
reverse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Maybe.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And it surprised me a little bit. The record may show
two different responses there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could we recover that now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The switch is on the west doorjamb of that door between the two
rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Perhaps that may help, Mrs. Paine. When you are in the kitchen
about to enter the garage, the doorway from the kitchen to the garage, and you
are going to enter from the kitchen into the garage, where is the switch with
respect to whether it is on your right side or your left side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just coming into the garage it is on my right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is leaving your kitchen entering the garage it is on your
right side. Now when you are in the garage and you are about to enter the
kitchen, the switch then is on your left? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That clarifies it. May I now ask in your observations
of either Marina or Lee, were they the type that were conscious of turning light
switches on or off? Was this an automatic reaction? Were they careless about
it? What was their trait if you have any observation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall any other time that the garage light had been left
on, and I would say certainly I saw enough of Marina to be able to state what
I thought would be a trait, and she would normally turn off a light when she
was done, in the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She had the normal reaction of turning a light off if she
left a room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Her own room. Now you see most of the rooms&mdash;if she was the
last one in the room she would turn it off; yes; going to bed or something like
that she certainly would turn it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of course if she was going to bed she would turn the light off.
But when she was leaving the room, was it her tendency to turn off the light?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, the garage light is the only room in my house you leave
not to come back to right away. The whole house is active all the time until
bedtime. It is hard to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So the lights are on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would you make any observation about Lee's tendencies
or traits in this regard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't say I have observation as to his tendencies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was your habit, however, as far as you are concerned with
respect to the light in the garage to turn it off when you left the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were your habits with respect to closing the main garage
door, that is the door opening onto the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was always closed except to open just to take out the trash
can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And though it is shown in one of the photographs as open.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was done for the purpose of the photograph by the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that normally your garage door is down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it down when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At your home when you were surprised to see Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it certainly was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have recollection whether anytime that evening of
hearing the garage door being raised or seeing the garage door up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no such recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection that it was down at all times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wasn't in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you entered the garage did you not that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Except then; yes, at 9 or so. It was certainly down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was down then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say your home is small and you can hear even the front
door opening. Does the raising of the garage door cause some clatter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had the garage door been raised, even though you were
giving attention to your children, would you have heard it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If it was raised slow and carefully; no, I would not have heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But if it were raised normally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You would have heard it. And it is your recollection that at
no time that evening were you conscious of that garage door having been raised.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had reached the point at which you said you entered the
garage to, did you say, lacquer some blocks which you had prepared?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you notice in the garage when you entered it to
lacquer those blocks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The garage was as I always found it, and I went and got the
lacquer from the workbench on the west side of the garage and painted the
blocks on top of the deepfreeze. My motions were in the interior portion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is in the area of the garage near the kitchen entrance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long were you in the garage on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. About a half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you leave the garage light on while you worked in the
garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are definitely conscious, however, of the fact that when
you entered the garage the light was on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am certain of that. I thought it quite sloppy to have left it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make any inquiry of Marina or of Lee Oswald as to the
light having been left on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No comment at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is my recollection that by the time I was ready to go to the
garage to work, say 9 o'clock, Lee had already retired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now we would like to know, tell us how you were definitely
conscious that he had retired by that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was in the bedroom. Traffic between the bedroom where he
was and the bathroom crosses in front of the doorway, the front of the room
where I was.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see him in the bedroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the bedroom?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; but I'd <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; but I'd be fairly certain I saw him go to it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You saw him go to it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw him passing back and forth from the bedroom to the
bathroom and he had his ablutions and then returned to the bedroom to retire,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your definite consciousness?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All of this was so common that I made no specific note of it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think you have got to tell what you remember that night.
If you can't remember it, you can't remember it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do remember him passing back and forth from the
bedroom that he and Marina normally occupied when he was there, and she
occupied when she was there, to the bathroom, and then back to the bedroom.
You do have that recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall specifically the feeling that he was in the room, and
this grounded no doubt in his having been back and forth as you have described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You remained in the garage about a half hour lacquering your
children's blocks.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You left the garage then, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did you go when you left the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the kitchen or living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see anybody when you entered the kitchen or living
room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; Marina was still up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see Lee Oswald anytime from that moment forward
until you retired for the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I saw Lee Oswald at no time from that moment forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The answer to my question is no?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you speak with him or he with you at anytime from that
moment forward until you retired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you conscious that he spoke to Marina at anytime from
that moment forward until you retired that evening?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was not conscious that he spoke to Marina; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or she with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or she with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What time that evening did you retire?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would guess around 11 or 11:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina remain up and retire at anytime or had she retired
earlier?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seems to me we remained up and retired at about the same
time, having folded laundry on the sofa before we retired, and talked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you looking at the television while you were doing the
folding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now let us return to the garage for a moment. When you were
in the garage for the half hour, did you notice the blanket wrapped package
you testified about yesterday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't specifically recall seeing it; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You first weren't conscious of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't stumble over it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It wasn't drawn to your attention in any fashion. Is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, as you and Marina sat that evening, folding the ironing,
what did you discuss?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion that might serve to refresh your recollection,
any discussion of the fact that Lee Oswald had come home or come
to Irving in the first place on a Thursday afternoon, which is unusual, or that
he had come home unannounced and without invitation, which also as you have
testified was unusual? Wasn't there any discussion between you and Marina,
speculation at least on your part as to why he was home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, there was discussion. I can't recall exactly what time in
the evening it took place but I recall the content of the discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You tell us about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She suggested that he was making up the quarrel that they had
had because of her attempt to reach him by telephone, and I agreed, concurred
with that judgment of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the attitude that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was very warm and friendly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there anything unusual about his attitude and conduct
that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing except he went to bed a little earlier than he normally
would have on a Sunday evening before work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you conscious of the fact that he was retiring a little
earlier than he normally would?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you speculate in your mind as to why that might be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I knew that he would go to bed as early as 10 o'clock say
on the Sunday evening before going to work the next day. This was just, still
early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was Marina's attitude toward him that evening? Was
she reserved because of this quarrel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I think she felt the best thing was to pass it by and not
discuss it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your impression of her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of her conduct.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is just your idea about it, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, and that I saw her do exactly, that too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do exactly what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She didn't ask him why he had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. You were present when Marina put a question
<span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She did not ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. She did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Certainly not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any impression as to how long he had been at your
home prior to your driving down the street and first seeing him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He usually arrived from his ride with Wesley Frazier somewhere
around a quarter of 5, so I guess it was a few minutes to 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You arrived at your home in the neighborhood of 5:25 or 5:30.
So it is your impression that he had been at your home from 10 to 15 minutes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I say from a few minutes to 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A few minutes to 10 minutes. Did Marina say anything that
evening of his having a package with him when he came to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No discussion of that nature occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am going to put a general question to you. Do you have any
recollection at all of Lee Oswald actually being in the garage of your home that
evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have said that I had the feeling from traffic that had preceded
it that he was in the bedroom when I saw he was no longer in the rest of the
house. When I saw the light was on, my distinct thought was that he had left
it on. I think that was founded upon an awareness of what Marina had been
doing and I suppose what he was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say doing. You mean an <span class="locked">awareness&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In other words, it was common for both Marina and Lee to go
to the garage, but when I saw the light was on I was certain it was Lee that
had left it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rather than Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Rather than Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because of her habit of turning off lights?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not only that. I feel that I&mdash;memory of what she had been
doing during the time that I was also putting the children to bed. She was
involved with the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May we possibly do this. Did you see Marina in the garage at
anytime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not see Lee Oswald in the garage at anytime that
evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Did not see him in the garage; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I intend at this moment to proceed to the next day.
I wondered if members of the Commission have any further questions of Mrs.
Paine with respect to the afternoon or evening of November 21?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I don't have any. I think she has covered it all. I would remind
you that we have got to be leaving, Mr. Ford and I, and Senator Cooper around
noon. We would like to make as much progress as we can before we go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is fine. I will have completed this phase.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. If you can get through the events of the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You retired along about 11:30?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The evening of the 21st. Did you sleep through the night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I woke at 7:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The children did not awaken you at anytime during the night
and nothing else awakened you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall that anything woke me; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is your recollection sufficient that you were not awakened during
the night, that is your definite impression at the moment?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I get up often in the night to change a diaper or cover a child,
but this is a matter of habit and I don't recall whether this night contained such
a getting up or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You sleep with your children, do you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We are in the same bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You awakened when in the morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At 7:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when you awakened, immediately after you awakened what
did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I awoke I felt the house was extremely quiet and the
thought occurred to me that Lee might have overslept. I wondered if he had
gotten up in time to get off around 7 o'clock because I knew he had to go to meet
Wesley Frazier to catch his ride. I looked about and found a plastic coffee cup in
the sink that had clearly been used and judged he had had a cup of coffee and left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see any other evidence of his having had breakfast?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was all he normally had for breakfast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A plastic coffee cup with some remains in it of coffee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Instant coffee; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his habit with respect to his breakfast when he made
his visits?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was very normal for him to take coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina up and about when you arose at 7:30?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection of the garage area? Was the door
to the garage, the entrance to the garage from the kitchen, closed or open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was closed. Would it help if I tried to narrate what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Go ahead and narrate.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I fixed breakfast for myself and my children, turned on the television
set to hear President Kennedy speak in Fort Worth, and had breakfast
there. I left the house about 9 with my little girl and boy, because she had
a dentist appointment, the little girl. I left the television set on, feeling that
Marina might not think to turn it on, but I knew that she would be interested
to see President Kennedy.</p>

<p>I then was gone until nearly noon, 11:30 or so, both to the dentist and on
some errands following that, came back and there was coverage of the fact
of the motorcade in Dallas, but there was no television cameras showing it,
as you know, and Marina thanked me for having left the television set on. She
said she woke up in kind of a bad mood, but she had seen the arrival of
President Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy at the airport in Dallas, and had been
thrilled with this occasion and with the greeting he had received, and it had
lifted her spirits.</p>

<p>Very shortly after this time, I had only just begun to prepare the lunch, the
announcement was made that the President had been shot, and I translated
this to Marina. She had not caught it from the television statement. And I
was crying as I did the translation. And then we sat down and waited at the
television set, no longer interested in the preparing of lunch, and waited to hear
further word.</p>

<p>I got out some candles and lit them, and my little girl also lighted a candle,
and Marina said to me, "Is that a way of praying?", and I said "Yes, it is,
just my own way." And it was well over an hour before we heard definitely
that the President was dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did that come to your attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was announced on the television. I think it was even still
in the intervening time. It was announced on the television that the shot which
was supposed to have killed the President was fired from the Texas School
Book Depository Building on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you communicate that to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina at this time was in the yard hanging some clothes. I
recall going out to her and telling her this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe she said anything. I then <span class="locked">also&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. You say "I don't believe she said anything." Is
it your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall anything at all that she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You told her that you had heard over the television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I heard that the shot had been <span class="locked">made&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Coming from the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Schoolbook depository, and I believe I also said I didn't know there
was a building on Elm.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Why did you go out to tell her, this fact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt this was terribly close, somebody working in that building
had been there. I thought Lee might be able to say somewhat about what
happened, had been close to the event. This was my thought, that we would
know somebody who would be able to give or possibly give a <span class="locked">first-hand&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you have any thought at all that Lee Oswald might have
been the man who fired the shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely none; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why was that, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had never thought of him as a violent man. He had never
said anything against President Kennedy, nor anything about President Kennedy.
I had no idea that he had a gun. There was nothing that I had seen
about him that indicated a man with that kind of grudge or hostility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But you told this to Marina because of the association of Lee
Oswald with the schoolbook depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I then proceeded to hang some clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did not comment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She did not comment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Made no comment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection, that she made no comment. I then
helped hang the clothes. My recollection skips then to being again in front
of the television listening, and it was then that we heard that the President
was dead. We were both sitting on the sofa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina had come in from the yard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the hanging of the clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall whether we came in together or whether she preceded
me into the house while I finished hanging up the clothes. But I do
recall then next sitting on the sofa when the announcement was definitely made
that the President was dead. And she said to me "What a terrible thing this
was for Mrs. Kennedy and for the two children." I remember her words were,
"Now the two children will have to grow up without the father." It was very
shortly after this we were still sitting on the sofa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Just take a little time and compose yourself.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My neighbor, Mrs. Roberts, came in, really I think to see if we
had heard, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Why don't you rest a few minutes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can proceed. I recall my feeling of anger with her for not
being more upset, or she didn't appear to me to be, any more than reporting a
remarkable news item. Then it was shortly after that that the bell rang and
I went to the door and met some six officers from the sheriff's office and police
station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this approximately 3:30 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I think it was earlier, but I wouldn't be certain. I know
that we had put our children to bed. They were all taking a nap, though I
am not certain. Yes, my little girl was asleep also. I cried after I had heard
that the President was dead, and my little girl was upset, too, always taking
it from me more than from any understanding of the situation. And she cried
herself to sleep on the sofa, and I moved her to her bed, and Christopher was
already asleep in his crib. June was in bed asleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina emotional at all? Did she cry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. She said to me, "I feel very badly also, but we seem to
show that we are upset in different ways." She did not actually cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I go back a moment there, if I may. You said you were
sitting on the sofa&mdash;that she and you were sitting on the sofa. While you
were listening or looking at the television, was there any announcement over
the television of a suspicion being cast at Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It had just been announced that they had caught someone in
a theatre, but there was no name given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. So up to this point there was no suggestion that Lee was
involved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; not until the time the officers came to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Not until the officers came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Do you want to ask me about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Now, the officers came to the <span class="locked">door&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Pardon me. Were you asking a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was waiting for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Senator Cooper reminded me that there were comments, apparently
to the effect that somebody from that building had fired the shots.
Did you hear that when you were sitting on the sofa with Marina? Did
you hear that comment on the television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that was earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That was even earlier?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; before it was announced that he was dead.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But when you were all sitting <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was at that point that I went out to the yard to tell her.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. To tell her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. After that when you went back in and you all were sitting
on the sofa and she was there, were there any other comments over the television
that someone from this building had fired the shot or that any suspects
<span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You mean, someone associated with the building?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that was not said.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. There was nothing else said about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; just that the shot came from the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Nothing else that you heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing else about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, you do have a definite recollection that you communicated
to Marina out in the yard that the shot had come from the Texas
School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did she do when you communicated that to her,
apart from what she said? You told us what she said. What did she do? Did
she come in the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she enter the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know. I never saw her enter the garage, but my recollection
is that I was outside hanging clothes after I told her this, but what I
can't recall is whether she remained with me hanging the clothes or whether
she went in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She might have gone into the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She might have gone into the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, in any event, you do not recall her entering the garage
following your advising her of the announcement that the shot had come, or
was thought to have come from the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not recall.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When you went out to tell her, was she hanging clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was hanging clothes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Then did you go help her, and then both of you were hanging
clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I then helped her. What I can't remember is whether she remained
and finished the job with me. I remember I finished, remained until
they were all hung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you remember at anytime after that whether or not you
were hanging clothes alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is what I am not certain about. I could well have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At anytime that afternoon, in any event, up to the time that
the policeman rang your doorbell, did you observe or were you aware that
Marina had entered the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wasn't aware that she had entered, if she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from your testimony it is possible that Marina, after
you advised her that the shot was thought to have come from this Texas School
Book Depository, that she might have been inside your home while you were
still out in the yard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, of course, if that is so, then she could have entered the
garage while she was inside your home, and you were out in the yard hanging
clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I would not have seen her; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this clothes-hanging occurred in the rear, the yard portion
in the rear of your home; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it possible&mdash;is there a window in the garage opening on the
rear of your home on to that yard area, or is the wall blank?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The window one can look into from the area where one hangs
clothes goes to the dining area. From where I stood, I could not have seen the
door entering the garage, which would be just <span class="locked">beyond&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are talking about the inside door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. First I would like to know <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The answer to your question is clear if you see the plan of the
interior of the house. No part of the garage shows, no wall or window or any
part of the garage shows from the <span class="locked">back&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is no opening from the rear of the garage, is there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you can't see into the garage, at least <span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From the back of my house you can't; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There are windows opening from your kitchen into the back part,
into the yard, are there not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And being in the yard, could you see when somebody passed across
that window, let us say, headed for the garage area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. Heading for the garage area, you would not pass across that
window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You would not. In any event, you had no consciousness at anytime
that day or afternoon of Marina having entered the garage up to the time
the police came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that true of the time in the morning that you have been
describing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At anytime from 7:30 in the morning, from the time you awakened
until the time the police came, you have no consciousness that Marina was in
the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No consciousness of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you enter the garage during this period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no specific recollection of having done so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have given us Marina's total exclamation or response
to your advising her that the shot had come from the Texas School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have recounted that your next-door neighbor, Mrs. Robert&mdash;or
is it Roberts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Came over. Was Marina <span class="locked">present&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When she arrived at your home? Were you girls in the living
room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you sit down and talk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. She just came to the door to see if we had heard the news.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was there just a bit of the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. She did not come, actually, into the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did not. She stood in the doorway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did she speak to you and to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, she spoke in English, and I doubt she said much more than,
"Have you heard?".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina say anything to you for translation of Mrs. Reynolds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. Roberts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Roberts; while Mrs. Roberts was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Learning that you girls were aware of the events up to that
moment, she left and, as far as you know, returned to her home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that morning&mdash;if I may, Mr. Chairman, because of the
entry of the police, that is a good cutoff point, I would like to go back to the
morning for the moment, or the evening before. Mrs. Paine, did you then have
what might be called some curtain rods in your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they were stored in the garage, wrapped in loose brown
paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it the brown paper of the nature and character you described
yesterday that you get at the market and have in a roll?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you wrapped that package yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, curtain rods can be of various types. One type of curtain
rod, as I remember, is a solid brass rod. Others are hollow. Some are shaped.
Would you describe these curtain rods, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They were a light weight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me; do you still have them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I still have them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Metal rods that you slip the curtain over, not with a ring but
just with the cloth itself, and they are expansion rods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are they flat on one side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They are flat on one side; about an inch wide and about a
quarter of an inch thick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And assume we are holding the rod horizontally, do the edges
of the rod slip over?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you wrap these rods in the paper? Had you wrapped
them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Sometime previously I had.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How long before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, possibly a year.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Possibly a year.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. As far as you know, they had never been changed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Moved about, but not changed.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Can you just describe the length?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The length of the rods, at the time you wrapped them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They would be 36 inches when pushed together.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They would be about maybe 36 inches when pushed together.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You remember wrapping them. Do you remember what the
size, the length of the rods were at the time you wrapped them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Didn't I answer about 36 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, you pushed them together so that then, they were
then their minimum length, unexpanded?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were not extended, and in that condition they were 36
inches long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, how many of them were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These were lightweight metal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very. Now, there was another item that was both heavier
and longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In that same package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think so. In another similar package wrapped up
just to keep the dust off were two Venetian blinds. I guess they were not
longer, more like 36 inches also, that had come from the two windows in my
bedroom. I took them down to change, and put up pull blinds in their place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had you wrapped them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was their length?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think around 36 inches. The width of these windows in the
back bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let us return to the curtain rods first. Do you still have those
curtain rods?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You believe so, or you know; which?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think Michael went to look after the assassination, whether
these were still in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a conversation with Michael as to whether he
did or didn't look?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why was he looking to see if the curtain rod package was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was particularly interested in the wrapping, was the wrapping
still there, the brown paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did this take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. After the assassination, perhaps a week or so later, perhaps
when one of the FBI people were out; I don't really recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was the package with the curtain rods found on that
occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is my recollection it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about the Venetian blind package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Still there, still wrapped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are fully conscious of the fact that that package is still
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief the
other package, likewise, is there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Let me ask a question there. After the assassination, at
anytime did you go into the garage and look to see if both of these packages
were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A week and a half, or a week later.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. At any time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Did I, personally?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Have you seen these packages since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seems to me I recall seeing a package.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall opening it up and looking in carefully. I seem
to recall seeing the package.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Both of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Or just one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Both.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you feel them to see if the rods were in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I think Michael did, but I am not certain.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But you never did, yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was not my most <span class="locked">pressing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was not the most pressing thing I had to do at that time.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I know that. But you must have read after the assassination
the story about Lee Oswald saying, he told Mr. Frazier, I think, that he was
carrying some curtain rods in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you remember reading that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I remember reading that.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Didn't that lead you&mdash;Did it lead you then to go in and see
if the curtain rods were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was all I could do at that point to answer my door, answer
my telephone, and take care of my children.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I understand you had many things to do.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So I did not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You never did do it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not certain whether I specifically went in and checked on
that. I recall a conversation with Michael about it and, to the best of my
recollection, things looked as I expected to find them looking out there. This
package with brown paper was still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By any chance, does that package appear in the photograph that
you have identified of the interior of your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it is this that is on a shelf almost to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I get over here, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Along the west edge of the garage, up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In view of this, I think it is of some importance that you mark
on Commission Exhibit 429 what appears to you to be the package in which
the curtain rods were.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now the witness has by an arrow indicated a shelf very close
to the ceiling in the rear of the garage, and an arrow pointing to what appears
to be a long package on that shelf, underneath which she has written "Wrapping
paper around venetian <span class="locked">blinds"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "And thin."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the next word?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "Curtain rods."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There were two packages, Mrs. Paine, one with the rods and
one with the Venetian blinds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall. The rods were so thin they hardly warranted
a package of their own, but that is rationalization, as you call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do have a recollection that those rods were a very lightweight
metal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. They were not round.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were flat and slender?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were not at all heavy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were curved? Were they curved in any respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They curved at the ends to attach to the bracket that held them
up on the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I use the chalk on the board, Mr. Chairman. Perhaps it
might be better for you, Mrs. Paine, so I don't influence you. Would you draw
a picture of the rods?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You are looking down from the top. It attaches here, well, over
a loop thing on the wall. Looking from the inside, it curves over a slight bit,
and then this is recessed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am going to have to have you do that over on a sheet of paper.
Will you remain standing for the moment. We will give it an exhibit number.
But I would like to have you proceed there. What did you say this was, in the
lower diagram?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You are looking down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, where was the break?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The break?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said they were extension.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. When they are up on the window, it would be
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have drawn a double line to indicate what would be seen
if you were looking down into the U-shape of the rod?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The double line indicates what on either side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That the lightweight metal, white, turned over, bent around,
something less than a quarter of an inch on each side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you be good enough to make the same drawing.
We will mark that sheet as Commission Exhibit No. 449 upon which the witness
is now drawing the curtain rod.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibit No. 449 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While you are doing that, Mrs. Paine, would you be good enough
when you return to Irving, Tex., to see if those rods are at hand, and some of
our men are going to be in Irving next week. We might come out and take a
look at them, and perhaps you might surrender them to us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You are perfectly welcome to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you in that connection, Mrs. Paine, do not open the
package until we arrive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I won't even look, then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, would you mark "A" in the upper elevation
and "B" in the lower elevation. The elevation in the drawing you have indicated
as "A" is a depiction of what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The curtain rod, as you might look at it from the top when it
is hanging in its position, when it is placed in position on the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And "B"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "B" is as it might appear if you could look at it from outside
the house; the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While the rod was in place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. While the rod was in place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have written to the left-hand side "Place at which it attaches
to wall fixture," indicating the butt end of the curved side of the rod?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the two oblongs, each of which you have put at the ends
of depiction "B," represent the upturned ends of the fixtures at each end?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you put a little line as to where the break was in the rod.</p>

<p>I offer in evidence, Mr. Chairman, as Commission Exhibit No. 449 the drawing
that the witness has just made, and about which she has testified.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. It will be admitted as part of the evidence.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibit No. 449 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had there been any conversation between you and Lee Oswald,
or between you and Marina, or any conversation taking place in your presence
prior to this occasion, in which the subject of curtain rods was mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; there was no such conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the subject of curtain rods&mdash;had that ever been mentioned
during all of these weekends that Lee Oswald had come to your home, commencing,
I think you said, with his first return on October 4, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It had not been mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Never by anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. By anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had the subject of curtain rods been mentioned even inadvertently,
let us say, by some neighbor talking about the subject, as to whether
you had some curtain rods you weren't using?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That might be loaned? I think you had testified that the curtain
rods, when unextended, were 36 inches long, approximately?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is a guess. I would say, thinking further about it, it must
be shorter than that. One went over a window that I am pretty sure was 30
inches wide, and one went over a window that was 42 inches wide, so it had
to extend between these. They were identical, and had served at these different
windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The rods were identical in length when unextended?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or when fully extended; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or when fully extended.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or when fully extended; yes. They could be extended to as
great as 42 inches?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At least that. I am just saying what windows they were used for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If the rods are still available, we will be able to obtain them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And we will know exactly their length, extended and unextended.
Now, as you think further about it, the rods when not extended, that is, when
pushed together, might be but 30 inches long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because you recall that you have a 30-inch-wide window.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe it is more that width than 36.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you hold up your hands to indicate what you think the
width or the length of the rods is when not extended?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I don't recall. Maybe like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you measure that, Mr. Liebeler, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About 28 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I intend to leave the subject of the curtain rods, gentlemen, if
you have any questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask a question. Did the FBI question you about the
curtain rods any, or the Dallas police officials?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not the Dallas police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Not the Dallas police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. It is possible the FBI did. I don't recall such question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They didn't take any rods from the garage that you are aware of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You are aware what the police took. I never did know exactly
what they took. I have never heard any mention of the rods having left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You are not conscious of the Dallas police ever talking to you
about curtain rods?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But possibly some member of the FBI did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Possibly. I can't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You can't recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever mention to the FBI anything, or anybody else up
until recently, the existence of the curtain rods about which you have now
testified?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have already said Michael and I discussed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A week or two after the assassination would be my guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you discuss those particular curtain rods about which
you have now testified?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We were particularly interested in seeing if the wrapping paper
that we used to wrap these things was there, and it was. I recall that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Lee Oswald know where you kept this roll of
wrapping paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my knowledge, he did not know where I kept it.
I had never wrapped something when he was around. Neither he nor Marina
had ever asked to use this paper or the string that I had.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where did you keep it? I don't recall precisely.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can be very clear. There is a picture here of a large secretary
desk on Commission Exhibit No. 435. It is in the bottom drawer, you see, in that
desk. This is not the secretary desk upon <span class="locked">which&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The note was found?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The note was found.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You kept it in the lower drawer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Along with some gum tape and string.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And this is the section shown on Commission Exhibit
435?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Reporter, you caught the measurement by Mr. Liebeler, 28
inches. Mrs. Paine, what is your best recollection as to how many curtain rods
there were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two, I am certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just two? And you wrapped the package yourself, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you and Michael undertook your discussion about
curtain rods, did you or did he open up this package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your present best recollection that as far as you know, the
package, as far as wrapping is concerned, is in the same condition now as when
you wrapped it initially?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Certainly very similar.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What was the answer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Certainly very similar. I don't recall making any change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there a possibility that the package was unwrapped at anytime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In connection with this inquiry of Michael's; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You think he might have but you don't know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or I might have. I don't recall. I recall that it wasn't something
that interested me as much as the other things I had to get done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But the rods about which you have testified as far as you know
are on the shelf in your garage at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall whether when the FBI discussed this subject with
you, if you can recall that, that you advised the FBI of these particular curtain
rods?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not perfectly certain that they discussed it with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just have no recollection of any interview with the FBI on
this particular subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seems to me they brought it up, but I don't recall the content
nor whether they went out. I certainly think I would remember if I had gone
out to the garage with an FBI representative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But I do not remember such an occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Unless the members of the Commission have any further questions
with respect to the curtain rods, I will return to the afternoon.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I want to ask just two questions. Before the assassination,
did you know where the package with the curtain rods in it was situated within
the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I gave it no attention but yes, it is my impression that I did go
out to see if things were where I expected to find them. They were wrapped
in brown paper, the curtain rods and venetian blinds. And found things there.
I don't recall that I looked into the package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did find the package?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the size of the package in length and width if you
can remember at the time you wrapped it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I suppose about like this, not closed but just wrapping paper
folded over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you hold your hands there please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. But by no means a neat package, just enough to keep the
dust off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thirty-two and a half inches.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What was the width of the package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Like so.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That you wrapped?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Now I am not certain. I am really thinking now of the package
with the venetian blind. I don't recall exactly the package with the rods,
whether they were included in this other or whether they warranted a package
of their own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The witness indicated a width of approximately 7½ inches.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I will ask one other question. The ends of the rod which
are at right angles to the long surface, how long? What is their approximate
size?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two and a half inches to three inches.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two and a half to three inches.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anyone entering your home from the outside walking up your
driveway and looking in the windows, would they see anybody sitting on the
sofa you have described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you sit on the sofa to look at your television set?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you take the ground floor plan that is before you and
<span class="locked">indicate&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Do you want me to draw in the sofa and the television set?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; I just want you to put an "X" as to where the sofa is, and
put a double "X" as to where the television set is. Now the opening that appears
to the left of the double "X," is that a window or a door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is there any window in that wall, in the living room wall.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Practically the rest of the wall is window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on this drawing it appears as a solid wall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The fact is that is a picture window?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. It is just your printing filled in. It is exactly like
this. There it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Turning to Commission Exhibit 431, the picture window is
shown there, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now it would be possible, would it not, if someone walked along
the sidewalk and was intent on peering in to see if anyone is there, to see somebody
sitting at the sofa looking at the television set?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I am very anxious to hear your story before we leave.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I can stay here while the details are filled in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The police arrived and what occurred.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I went to the door. They announced themselves as from both
the sheriff's office and the Dallas Police Office, showed me at least one package
or two. I was very surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said nothing. I think I just dropped my jaw. And the man in
front said by way of explanation "We have Lee Oswald in custody. He is
charged with shooting an officer." This is the first I had any idea that Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
might be in trouble with the police or in any way involved in the day's events. I
asked them to come in. They said they wanted to search the house. I asked
if they had a warrant. They said they didn't. They said they could get the
sheriff out here right away with one if I insisted. And I said no, that was all
right, they could be my guests.</p>

<p>They then did search the house. I directed them to the fact that most of
the Oswald's things were in storage in my garage and showed where the garage
was, and to the room where Marina and the baby had stayed where they would
find the other things which belonged to the Oswalds. Marina and I went with
two or three of these police officers to the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many police officers were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There were six altogether, and they were busy in various parts of
the house. The officer asked me in the garage did Lee Oswald have any weapons
or guns. I said no, and translated the question to Marina, and she said yes;
that she had seen a portion of it&mdash;had looked into&mdash;she indicated the blanket roll
on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the blanket roll on the floor at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She indicated the blanket roll on the floor very close to where
I was standing. As she told me about it I stepped onto the blanket roll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This might be helpful. You had shaped that up yesterday and
I will just put it on the floor.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And she indicated to me that she had peered into this roll and
saw a portion of what she took to be a gun she knew her husband to have, a
rifle. And I then translated this to the officers that she knew that her husband
had a gun that he had stored in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you standing on the blanket when you <span class="locked">advised&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When I translated. I then stepped off of it and the officer picked
it up in the middle and it bent so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It hung limp just as it now hangs limp in your hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And at this moment I felt this man was in very deep trouble and
may have <span class="locked">done&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Were the strings still on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The strings were still on it. It looked exactly as it had at previous
times I had seen it. It was at this point I say I made the connection with
the assassination, thinking that possibly, knowing already that the shot had
been made from the School Book Depository, and that this was a rifle that was
missing, I wondered if he would not also be charged before the day was out with
the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When the officer picked up the blanket package, did you hear any
crinkling as though there was paper inside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No crinkling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever. When you stepped on the package, did you
have a feeling through your feet that there was something inside the package
in the way of paper.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not anything in the way of paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or wrapping.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or anything that crinkled; no. I did think it was hard but that
was my cement floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But definitely you had no sensation of any paper inside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No such sensation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the nature or character of the wrapping paper you identified
yesterday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; and when he picked it up I would think such paper would
rattle, but there was no such sound. Marina said nothing at this time. She was
very white, and of course I <span class="locked">judged&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she blanch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She is not a person to immediately show her feelings necessarily.
She was white. I wouldn't say that it was a sudden thing. I can't be certain
that it was sudden at that point.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How close was she standing to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From here to there, about 6 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The officers then said they would like me and Marina to go down
to the police station, and I said well, I would seek to try to get a baby-sitter
to come to stay with the children so that we might accompany them. About
this time, we then left the garage as I recall, because then Michael Paine arrived
at the front door. I was in the living room when he came. And I said "Did
you know to come" and he said that he had heard Oswald's name mentioned on
the radio, and had come over directly, for which I may say I was very glad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How far away from your home&mdash;where did he live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It would take about a half hour drive&mdash;he was working&mdash;from
where he was working to come, 20 minutes perhaps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have the address at the tip of your tongue?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Where he works; no. I don't know the address. I know how
to get to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know where he lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He lived at the Villa Fontaine Apartments, apartment 217, 2377
Dalworth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. D-A-L-W-O-R-T-H?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. D-A-L-W-O-R-T-H, in Grand Prairie, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is Grand Prairie, Tex.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Grand Prairie is suburban to Dallas, between Dallas and Fort
Worth, nearer to Dallas, and it was a location very near to where he worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What distance in miles from your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You measure distance in minutes in Texas; driving time. I don't
know; 20 minutes to where he lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, proceed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The police officers then asked if Michael would also accompany
us to the police station and he said he would. I changed clothes to a suit from
slacks, and went to the house of my babysitter. She has no telephone. I need
to walk to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was Marina in the meantime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina remained in the house with the children. Lynn by this
time had awakened as I recall. Christopher was still sleeping and I think June
was also. And I said I would walk over to my neighbors to ask if&mdash;there was
something that intervened I just remembered. I first went and asked my immediate
neighbor, Mrs. Roberts, if she could keep the children for a short time
in the afternoon, but she was just on her way to go somewhere. She couldn't.
So then I went to the home of the person I normally have for a baby-sitter.
It was now after school or this babysitter would not have been there, which
brings us to 3:30 perhaps. And I asked the mother if the young girl, teenage
girl, could come and stay at the house. I was accompanied to the house by
one of the officers. As we left the house I said "Oh, you don't have to go with
me." Oh, he said, he'd be glad to. And then it occurred to me he had been
assigned to go with me, and I said "come along." It was the first I have ever
experienced being in the company of people who suspected me of anything, and
of course that is their business.</p>

<p>We did arrange then for the girls to come back, one or two, I forget whether
it was two of the daughters or one that came then to my house to stay with
the children. As I came back, I noticed the officers carrying a number of
things from the house, and I looked into the back of one of the cars. It was
across the street from my house, and saw he had three cases of 78 records
of mine, and I said, "You don't need those and I want to use them on Thanksgiving
weekend. I have promised to lead a folk dance conference on the
weekend. I will need those records which are all folk dance records and I
doubt that you might get them back at that time."</p>

<p>And I said, "that is a 16 mm projector. You don't want that. It is mine."</p>

<p>And he took me by the arm and he said, "We'd better get down to the
station. We have wasted too much time as it is." And I said, "I want a list
of what you are taking, please." Or perhaps that was before. As much answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
as I ever got was "We'd better get to the station." Then I evidently
had made them nervous because when we got back from this car to the house,
Marina wanted to change from slacks as I had already done to a dress. They
would not permit her to do that. I said "She has a right to, she is a woman,
to dress as she wishes before going down." And I directed her to the bathroom
to change. The officer opened the bathroom door and said no, she had no
time to change. I was still making arrangements with the babysitters, arranging
for our leaving the children there, and one of the officers made a statement
to the effect of "we'd better get this straight in a hurry Mrs. Paine or we'll
just take the children down and leave them with juvenile while we talk to you."</p>

<p>And I said "Lynn, you may come too" in reply to this. I don't like being
threatened. And then Christopher was still sleeping so I left him in the house
and Lynn, my daughter, and Marina took her daughter and her baby with her
to the police station, so we were quite a group going into town in the car.
Michael was in one car, Marina and I and all the children were in another with
three police officers as I recall. One of them spoke some Czech, tried to understand
what was being said. The one in the front seat turned to me and said
"Are you a Communist," and I said, "No, I am not, and I don't even feel the
need of a Fifth Amendment." And he was satisfied with that. We went on
then to the police station, and waited until such time as they could interview us.
They interviewed Michael at one point separately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Separately?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And they interviewed Marina while I was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you interpret for her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They had an interpreter there, a Mr. Ilya Mamantov whom I
was very glad to see. He is the son-in-law of a woman who has tutored me
in Dallas, so I had met him before. I was very glad to have someone whose
skill in Russian was greater than mine, and Marina had said even in the car
going down to the station, "your Russian has suddenly become no good at all."
She had asked me again in the car, "isn't it true that the penalty for shooting
someone in Texas is the electric chair" and I said "yes, that is true."</p>

<p>Then at the police <span class="locked">station&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask this. Was there any interrogation other
than what you have mentioned by police officers in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; none that I recall.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You and Marina talked back and forth freely or to
a limited degree?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We talked back and forth freely and then she wanted me to
translate to the officer, to the one who understood some Czech, to help him
understand. Then in the room where we were asked questions, what I particularly
recall was they wanted Marina to say what she had said in the
garage to the effect that she had seen a rifle in that wrapped blanket, and
she made the statement again and it was made up into an affidavit for her to
sign with Mr. Mamantov making very clear the translation of each sentence,
each word, and I recall her statement was to the effect that she had looked in
and seen a portion of the gun, of something which she took to be the gun
she knew her husband had; that she had not opened the package, but had
just looked into it.</p>

<p>They then brought <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, a slight interruption.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the occasion when Mrs. Oswald, Marina, made the remark
of having seen a weapon inside the blanket, was that the first notice that you
had of any kind or character that there was a weapon in your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is absolutely the first. Indeed it was contrary to my expectation
as I said. When the officer asked me I answered his question before
I even translated it, answered it in the negative, and then translated it and
found that indeed there had been a gun there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They then showed a gun, a rifle to Marina, and asked her if she
could identify the gun as being her husband's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
She said her husband had a dark gun, dark in color, that she wasn't absolutely
certain that this was the gun. She couldn't definitely recall the sight
on the top of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The telescope sight?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Then I also was asked to make an affidavit which I signed,
to the effect that I had heard her say in the garage that she had looked into
this package and seen what she took to be a rifle she knew her husband had.
It was after they had finished with this session that I went back in the same
room where Michael was, and Mrs. Oswald, senior, came in, Mrs. Marguerite
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you met her at anytime up to that moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I had never met her before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you ever talked with her at anytime up to that moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had never talked with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you advised in advance of anything that had been said
that she was to come?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. She said she had heard on her car radio, on her way to work
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What time was this about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She heard it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; that she came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was, it was certainly supper time. We had eaten no lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And she said she heard on her car radio that Lee Oswald had been
in custody in Dallas and had come over. Previously during October and November
Marina had told me she regretted that Lee didn't wish to keep up contact
with his mother because she thought it was only proper to tell the mother of
the coming grandchild, and then she wanted to announce the birth when the baby
had come but she said Lee didn't try to keep her address, and Marina didn't
know how to contact her or didn't want to do so around her husband certainly.
There was a warm greeting in the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Between whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Between Marguerite Oswald and Marina Oswald and I recall
both wept and Mrs. Marguerite Oswald exclaimed over the new baby, and then
held the baby. I then also met Robert Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did he come with relation to when Marguerite Oswald
entered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed to me later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you met Robert Oswald at anytime up to that moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion that had taken place during the course
of the day up to that moment indicating to you that Robert Oswald might or
would arrive on the scene?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; nothing that day about Robert at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he entered was there an indication to you at all that none
of the people, in addition to yourself, was aware that he was about to&mdash;that
they had any advance advice that he was going to be present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no indication of any advance advice to any of the
people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any indication to the contrary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think anyone was really surprised that he had come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was this lack of prior notice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Lack of prior notice. We then talked about where to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, does the "we" include your husband all the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The "we" then was a group at this point of my husband, Marguerite
Oswald, Marina Oswald, Robert Oswald, and myself, three children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your husband know Robert Oswald prior to this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they introduced to each other on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They were in the same room and they might have been. It was
agreed that Robert was to stay in a hotel. Marguerite Oswald asked if she
could come out and stay with Marina at my home, and it was agreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it agreed that Marina would stay at your house that night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; certainly all her baby things were there. So, we went back
there. We were taken back by police officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Everybody assumed she would return back to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion that would indicate any reluctance on
the part of anybody that she return to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever by anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct, none whatsoever by anybody.</p>

<p>The police officers brought us back to my home. It was by this time dark, and
I think it was about 9 o'clock in the evening. I asked Michael to go out and buy
hamburgers at a drive-in so we wouldn't have to cook, and we ate these as best
we could, and began to prepare to retire. We talked. I have a few specific
recollections of that period that I will put in here.</p>

<p>Just close to the time of retiring Marina told me that just the night before
Lee had said to her he hoped they could get an apartment together again soon.
As she said this, I felt she was hurt and confused, wondering how he could have
said such a thing which indicated wanting to be together with her when he
must have already been planning something that would inevitably cause separation.
I asked her did she think that Lee had killed the President and she said,
"I don't know." And I felt that this was not something to talk about really
anyway. But my curiosity overcame my politeness.</p>

<p>Now, back a little bit to the time in the living room, Mrs. Oswald and Michael
and Marina and I were all there, and Mrs. Oswald, I recall, said, I mean of
course Mrs. Marguerite <span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That if they were prominent people there would be three of
the lawyers down in the city jail now trying to defend her son, and coming to
his aid.</p>

<p>She felt that since they were just small people that there wouldn't&mdash;they
wouldn't get the proper attention or care, and I tried to say this was not a
small case. That most careful attention would be given it, but she didn't feel
that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made no impression on her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I made no impression on her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She made an impression on me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we would prefer if you would call her Marguerite. It
would avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. Somewhere in that evening before we retired, and
after we had eaten, the doorbell rang and two men from Life Magazine appeared.
I <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had any advance notice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We had had no advance notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nobody did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nobody did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You in particular and none of the others in the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None of the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would be quite certain that none of the others and <span class="locked">myself&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least that was your impression at the moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That they had no prior information that these people might
come. I will say I was not surprised that anyone of the press found his way to
our door at that point. If anything, I was surprised there weren't more. Life
Magazine was the only company or group to appear that evening. I permitted
them to come in, and I felt that Mrs. Marguerite Oswald was interested in the
possibility of their buying the story or paying for what information she and
Marina might give them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had that occurred to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Had that occurred to me? No. But then, too, I wasn't thinking
about pay for lawyers but she made that connection verbally in my presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Between the need for money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The availability of Life Magazine and the need to pay for a lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she was the one who raised that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she raised it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For commercialization of the story?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall now she raised it definitely enough that Mr. Tommy
Thompson of Life called, I believe still that evening, to see if he could offer
anything or what he might be empowered to offer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was all instigated by her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; very much so. I noticed that the other man, whose name I
forget, had a camera and I was amazed, and I also saw he took a picture and I
was amazed, he tried with a dim light in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say he took a picture, you don't mean he took a picture
from your living room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He took a picture in my living room. He photographed. I saw
him wind his roll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I made the mistake I now think of turning on another light
simply as an act of hostess, it was dim in the living room but I hadn't realized
until later that I was making it possible for him to take a picture.</p>

<p>I didn't know what was best for me to do as hostess. It seemed to me that
Mrs. Oswald, Sr., Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, was both interested in encouraging
the Life Magazine representatives and still didn't really want her picture taken,
and I had no personal objection to their being there. But I considered the
Oswalds my guests and I didn't want to have the Life Magazine people there if
they didn't want them. But they left fairly promptly, saying that they would
come back in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they say anything about your talking or not talking to any
other news media representatives until they had talked with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing of that implied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. It was after this that the conversation I have already
related with Marina took place, and we finished our preparations for bed. She
said to me she didn't think she would sleep fairly soon and asked if she could
borrow my hair dryer, she would stay up and take a shower, which she often
said renewed her spirits, and I then went to bed, having given her my hair
dryer. We woke perhaps something after 7 the next morning or closer to 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "we", who do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The household. I think we had not yet&mdash;we pretty much woke
all at once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your husband remain at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he remained at my home that night, the first time he had
been there in a great long time. We were still eating breakfast or had just
begun when the two Life people arrived again, this time with an interpreter, a
woman doctor whose name I don't remember, and Marguerite Oswald and
Marina Oswald, with her two little girls went with these two Life Magazine
people to downtown Dallas for the purpose of seeing Lee, and Marguerite
Oswald wanted to see that he got legal counsel immediately.</p>

<p>They were acting, the Life people were acting in this case as shovers, I feel,
and I also thought Marguerite Oswald was hoping that something could be
arranged between them, that would be financially helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything that further stimulated your thoughts and
reaction in that direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I don't recall specifically but I have the clear impression
<span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From her conversation with the Life representatives?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From her conversation. Yes. They left quite soon, I remember
wishing Marina had taken more time to have more breakfast since it was going
to be a trying day, and that is the last I saw her until March 9, in the evening,
very recently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. March 9, 1964?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just a week or so ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. She left, of course, expecting to come back. She
took only the immediate needs of the baby's diapers and bottle, and I fully
expected her to come back later that same day. I don't really recall. I think
there must have been some newsmen out then that morning, later that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To see you, at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At my home. I would be certain of that. The Houston Post&mdash;well,
yes. And Michael was there also, at least in the morning as I recall, and
talked with these people.</p>

<p>I believe the local paper, Irving News, was there. Then Michael, as I recall,
went to do something related to his work or had to do some shopping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He left your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Anyway, in the afternoon I was the only one there and I felt I
had better get some grocery shopping done so as to be prepared for a long stay
home just answering the doorbell and telling what I could to the people who
wanted to know. I was just preparing to go to the grocery store when several
officers arrived again from the Dallas Police Office and asked if they could
search.</p>

<p>This time I was in the yard, the front yard on the grass, and asked if they
could search and held up their warrant and I said, yes, they could search. They
said they were looking for something specific and I said, "I want to go to the
grocery store, I'll just go and you go ahead and do your searching."</p>

<p>I then went to the grocery store and when I came back they had finished and
left, locking my door which necessitated my getting out my key, I don't normally
lock my door when I go shopping.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you take your children shopping?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Always. Then about 3:30 or 4 I got a telephone call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The phone rang?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The phone rang; I answered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you recognize the voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recognized the voice but I don't recall what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did the voice say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The voice said: "This is Lee."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give your best recollection of everything you said and if you can,
please, everything he said, and exactly what you said.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said, "Well, Hi." And he said he wanted to ask me to call Mr.
John Abt in New York for him after 6 p.m. He gave me a telephone number
of an office in New York and a residence in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Two telephone numbers he gave you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One office and one residence of Mr. John Abt. Did he say who
Mr. John Abt was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said he was an attorney he wanted to have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Represent him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To represent him. He thanked me for my concern.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he tell you or ask you what you were to do or say to Mr. Abt
if you reached him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I carried the clear impression I was to ask him if he would
serve as attorney for Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Have you given the substance of the conversation in as much detail, of the
entire conversation, as you now can recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is a little more that <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Why don't you just go ahead and tell it as you remember it,
everything that he said and you said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't give the specific words to this part but I carry a clear
impression, too, that he sounded to me almost as if nothing out of the ordinary
had happened.</p>

<p>I would make this telephone call for him, would help him, as I had in other
ways previously. He was, he expressed gratitude to me. I felt, but did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
express, considerable irritation at his seeming to be so apart from the situation,
so presuming of his own innocence, if you will, but I did say I would make the
call for him.</p>

<p>Then he called back almost immediately. I gather that he had made the call
to me on the permission to make a different call and then he got specific permission
from the police to make a call to me and the call was identical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is speculation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is speculation but the content of the second call was almost
identical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The phone rang?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He asked me to contact John Abt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He identified himself and he asked you to make the call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He wanted me to call this lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you express any surprise for him to call back almost immediately
giving you the same message that he had given previously?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think somebody must have said, that the officers had said
he could call, make this call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything about the fact that he had already just
called you about the same subject matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He may have added.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I was quite stunned that he called at all or that he
thought he could ask anything of me, appalled, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did he say he was innocent, or did he just have this conversation
with respect to the retention of a counsel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At no time during either of those conversations did he deny
that he was in any way involved in this situation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He made no reference to why he was at the police station or why
he needed a lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He just assumed that you knew he was at the police station,
did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't say where he was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He just started out saying what you now say he said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But in no respect did he say to you that he was entirely innocent
of any charges that had been made against him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did not say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he mention the subject at all of the assassination of the
President or the slaying of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What you have given is your best recollection of the entire
conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This was Saturday afternoon, November 23?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. About what time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Four, perhaps in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Had you seen him the day before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Who was in the house with you when that call came in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just my children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Just your children.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. While you were shopping and after the officers had
come with a warrant, they went in the house, no one was in the house?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For a portion of the time they were looking, no one was in
the house.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. They were there alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did they indicate&mdash;were they still there when you got back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; they were not. Remember the door was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes; the door was locked, that is what I gather. Do you
know what they took on this occasion, or did they tell you what they were
coming for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I do not. Before I left they were leafing through books
to see if anything fell out but that is all I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In this interim then, I suppose I talked to some more news people
but I want to get to the next important point which was that Lee called again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A third time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I really call the first two one, but it was twice dialed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fix the time, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was around 9:30 in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was home? Was your husband there on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anyone else other than your children and yourself in your
home at the time of the receipt of the call in the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It could only have been Michael. I would remember someone
else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you have no definite recollection that even he was present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. The phone rang, you answered it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you recognize the voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recognized the voice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was Lee Oswald's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say and what did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said, "Marina, please," in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, Mrs. Paine, did he speak to you in English in the conversations
in the afternoon or in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He spoke in English the entire conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The two in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, however, he resorted to Russian, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. He planned to speak to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He planned to speak to Marina, and this opening phrase was one
he normally used calling as he had many previous times to speak to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was under the assumption, you gathered, that Marina was in
your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He certainly was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I would be fairly certain that I answered him in English.
I said she was not there, that I had a notion about where she might be, but I
wasn't at all certain. That I would try to find out. He said, he wanted me to&mdash;he
said he thought she should be at my house. He felt irritated at not having been
able to reach her. And he wanted me <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he sound irritated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he sounded just a slight edge to his voice. And he wanted
me to deliver a message to her that he thought she should be at my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he so instructed you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what he said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. That was so far as I remember, the entire conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What response did you give to his direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said I would try to reach her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His <span class="locked">direction&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And tell her his message.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine, in the meantime, had you sought to reach John Abt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had, after 6 o'clock, thank you. I had dialed both numbers
and neither answered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Neither answered. Was there any conversation between you and
Lee Oswald in the evening conversation to which you reported to him your inability
to reach Mr. Abt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not specifically recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or the subject of Mr. Abt at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't want to get into rationalization. I can judge that something
was said but I do not recall it specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, have you given the full extent of that conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At anytime during that conversation with Lee Harvey Oswald
did he assert or intimate in any form or fashion his innocence of any charges
against him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the assassination mentioned at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the shooting or murder of Officer Tippit mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have given everything that was said in that conversation as
best you are able to recall it at the moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. I then tried the only thing I knew to do, to try
to reach Marina. I had heard one of the FBI agents try to find her when
he was at my home, had dialed the hotel where the Life people were staying,
and asked to be put in contact with Marina and was told, I judge, because he
repeated it and wrote it down. Executive Inn. Here I am turning detective in
this small way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You also mentioned now for the first time there were FBI agents
in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the course of the day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I then <span class="locked">dialed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You shook your head, did you shake your head in the affirmative?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; there were FBI agents in my home during the day. One I
recalled made this telephone call. I was waiting to hear from Marina to see if
she wanted to talk with me. I had no desire to press her or to attempt to reach
her unless she wanted to reach me, but then with this message, I went ahead
and dialed the Executive Inn and asked for Tommy Thompson, and Marguerite
Oswald answered, and I said I would like to talk to Marina, and she said,
"Well, Marina is in the bathroom," and I said to Marguerite that Lee had called
me, that he wanted me to deliver a message to Marina, that he wished for her
to be at my home, and Marguerite Oswald said, "Well, he is in prison, he don't
know the things we are up against, the things we have to face. What he wants
doesn't really matter," which surprised me. And again I asked to speak to
Marina and waited until I did speak to her and delivered the same message in
Russian to her but there was no <span class="locked">further&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What response did Marina make to the message that you conveyed
to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said she was very tired and wanted to get to bed, as I recall,
and thought it was certainly best to stay there that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. And I certainly agreed with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything in response to your delivery of Lee Oswald's
message about Marina staying with you, of the possibility of her staying with
you, say, the next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing of that nature was said. I think I remember that we
did discuss whether she had seen Lee during the day, and on that occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
it seems to me I learned that she had seen him around noon but I may be
wrong about when I learned that. I knew she had seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either in that conversation or any other conversation with
Marina that you may have had, was the subject of Lee Oswald's attitude or
any comments he made mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nobody reported to you anything about any conversation they
might or did have with Lee Oswald either on the 22d or 23d or even on the
24th of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I am of the impression I again tried the home telephone
of John Abt on Sunday morning, but I am not certain, and there was no answer.
That I certainly remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you ever reach Abt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever attempt to report to Lee Oswald that you had
been unable to reach Mr. Abt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not unless such transpired in our 9:30 conversation Saturday
evening, but I made no effort to call the police station itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I made no effort to call the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have at anytime any further conversations with Lee
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than what you have now related?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you have any impression as to why he wanted Marina to
come back with you? Was it in order to make her available for telephone calls
from him or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What is distinctly my impression is that he thought she should
be available. That it was she wasn't where he could find her that irritated
him rather than that he thought this was the best place for her.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you know of Mr. Abt or was this <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had never heard of Mr. Abt before.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Never heard of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did Marguerite Oswald explain any further, in the statement
you said she made, about having too many obstacles or having obstacles
or having troubles?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Are you referring to the statement on Friday night when she
was at my home?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. No. I think you said a few minutes ago when she went to
the hotel you called her and told her what Lee Oswald had told you to tell
Marina.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think you said she said something <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "Well, he doesn't understand the things we are up against or
things of this nature." What I remember most clearly is that she didn't seem
to care whether he was told the truth or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, that is perhaps a further statement, told the truth about&mdash;had
it seemed to me a lack of respect on her part. She didn't care what his
wishes were in the situation, in other words. And this sticks in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any conversation with Robert Oswald on the 22d,
subsequent to the time that you met him when he first come to the police
station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you on the 23d of November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The 24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe the only other time I saw Robert was some 3 weeks
or more later when he came with two other people to pick up the rest of
Marina's things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then from the 22d of November until he came sometime in December
you had no conversation with him and you had not seen him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had no contact at all with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my best recollection. Marina called me around noon
on Sunday, the 24th. She said she was with the police, and, of course, this
was said in Russian; I don't know whether she meant Secret Service or Irving
Police or Dallas Police or what sort, but official. Her husband had already
been shot at this time, so it was just after. He had been shot and I had the
television on and I knew that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she know it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am certain she did. What makes me certain I can't recall
definitely. I felt that she was confining herself in her conversation to the things
she just had to say.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was directing me how to find certain things she needed
to have. A winter coat, things for the baby, a little purse with some money
in it that she left either on top of the dresser or in a drawer in the bedroom
where they had stayed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she sound less than <span class="locked">cordial&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no, she sounded, as I recall it, as a call from a woman who
was doing her best to simply achieve the things she had to do but was under
a tremendous strain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was any mention made of the death of her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was not yet dead, he had been shot but he was not yet dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was any mention made between you in this conversation of the
fact that Lee Oswald had been shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't mention it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not tell her; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you&mdash;it might be natural that you would express sympathy.
Did you mention the subject at all, sympathetical or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall mentioning the subject and as I say, I have this
distinct feeling that she knew, and I knew she knew but what caused that, I can't
identify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have the feeling, if I may use some vernacular, that she
was "under wraps" or rather she was bereft and just seeking to <span class="locked">do&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no feeling she was restraining herself from saying any
particular things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was under restraint?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From some outside source?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no such feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I then, well, I should say there were one or two officers from the
Irving Police Department there who were waiting to take the things that she
<span class="locked">directed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The police officers had already arrived at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I guess I remembered it as virtually simultaneous. I might
fill in, whether it is important to your inquiry or not, the moment the television
announced that Lee Oswald had been shot, an Irving Police patrol car that had
been going by my house and had hesitated in front, stopped and the officer got
out carrying a rifle and came into my house, closed the curtains and said he was
here to protect me. I later learned that he thought Mrs. Oswald, Marina Oswald,
was in the house, and he had been directed by his car radio to come in, and he then
closed all the blinds and peered out. And it was in the midst of this time that
Marina called, so you see the officers were there already on other business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The officer was in your home when you talked with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; when Marina made the call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything to the officers that Marina had called when
you finished that conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You told them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you tell them anything of the substance of the call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that I was to get some things and I think they had the same
information separately a different way from a car radio or something at the same
time, which was to put some things together to take to her. I did then pack one
or two, or even three of the suit cases we talked about yesterday with baby things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine. You keep referring to one or two or
three. Were there as many as three?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think there were as many as three, including a very small, you
might say, cosmetic case, only more, not as fancy as that. This was in her room,
and I recall looking in it and seeing a family album of photographs and thinking
this had better be in her hands, and included that along with clothes. I sent a
childs toy, some things that I thought might be helpful to her in keeping her
children happy as well as the individual items she had asked for specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you sense any note of estrangement at all between you and
Marina when she telephoned you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; the situation was strained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Strained because she hadn't reappeared, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; because her husband had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. No; I meant in your conversation with her was there any indication
of any coolness between you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; none I detected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you noticed any when you were in the police station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the previous day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None at all. So that up to the moment of this telephone conversation
and after you finished you had no feeling there was any estrangement,
any coolness, any change in attitude on the part of Marina toward you as a
person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Have you felt any evidence of that since?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and that has several parts to it and I could easily go into it
now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was going to ask her some general questions and Senator Cooper
asked me if I would permit her just to go through the day as she has without,
with a minimum of, interruptions so that you and he might, and Representative
Ford, might ask some general questions before you left, so that is what I have
done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Have you completed your report?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That brings us to the 24th so that all else is really quite post the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. There is one thing I would like to ask before I go, if I may, and
that is your husband testified that several times he had moved this blanket when
it was in the garage. Can you fix the date when he was in your house and working
in the garage so that he was compelled to move the blanket? When did he
come <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He normally came on Friday evening. He would sometimes come
on a Sunday afternoon, and either of those times could have been times that
he had worked in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That was all through September, October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; September, October; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But when he had been working there he never mentioned to you
any&mdash;about the existence of this blanket, package which he had been compelled
to move?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. That didn't come up until after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It didn't come up until after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, you are seeking to refresh your recollection from
what document, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am looking at a calendar to see if there is anyway that I can
tell when Michael was in the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Commission exhibit number what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 401. But it has not helped me in refreshing my memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you have contacts with the FBI and if so what were they
before the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. An FBI agent was out, I have learned since, on November 1.
I made no note of the day for myself. Sat down and talked in a relaxed way
and for sometime in my living room. He said that the FBI liked to make it
plain to people who have been in this country sometime, immigrated from an
iron curtain country if they were experiencing any blackmail pressure from
their home country, that they were welcome, and invited to discuss it with
the FBI if they so choose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Marina was present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she overhear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not certain&mdash;I tried to translate some of this conversation,
I am not certain how good my translation was or how well I conveyed it, or
even if I conveyed it to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do recall translating some of the conversation to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do recall translating some of the conversation indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you at times asked to address Marina to convey something
that the FBI agent asked you to convey to her and then to translate in the
reverse to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall anything as formal as that; no. The agent and
I conversed some in English. He said, for instance, that, well he was interested
in knowing if Lee Oswald lived here. I told him he did not, that he had a room
in town; he asked if I knew where the room was and I said I did not. He
asked if he was working and I said yes, and that he was working at the Texas
School Book Depository. I haven't gone over any of this yet, it must have
been in conversation with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You testified to this yesterday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought I did. It sounds familiar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I just wanted to fix for my own benefit the number of times
you saw FBI agents prior to the assassination in the company of Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was a succeeding date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was a succeeding date which again I have been told by the
FBI was November 5, the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall it was a few days after the first man came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I <span class="locked">recall&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall it was in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall it was in the early part of the week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the same gentleman call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The same gentleman. He had someone else along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was Mr. Hosty, the gentleman whom you now have in mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I now know his name as Hosty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. From that you knew that the FBI was still interested in the
activity of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is what I want to bring out. I think that is all I have,
the questions I have.</p>

<p>Are you going to take up later this estrangement as to how it developed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I shall do that this afternoon. Representative Ford has
afforded me a list of subjects upon which to make inquiry and I will do so this
afternoon. Perhaps Representative Ford and Senator Cooper, you would have
some questions of this lady before we adjourn for the luncheon period?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Are you going to continue this afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I will postpone mine until this afternoon. I think Mr.
McCloy and Congressman Ford have to go.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Jenner, I will give you these questions and use
those, if any, that are other than what you planned to use yourself. I am a
little interested and I would like to hear you tell it, if I could, Mrs. Paine,
how much did you know about the finances of Lee and Marina?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed to me they lived on a very small budget. In March
of the year, at either the first or second visit with her, she told me she lived
on something under, around $200 a month and this was more than they had
been, because they had just finished paying a debt that they had incurred for
their passage to this country and they were feeling rich on $200 a month, and
I could see she was a good planner in what she bought. I could see they seldom,
if ever, bought clothes for themselves or even for June. In the fall then Lee
never volunteered or gave any money for the cost of her being at my house.
He did on one occasion buy a few things at the grocery store for, at Marina's
request, which he paid for, and on another occasion I was aware that he had
given her some money to buy shoes. Did I mention this previously?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yesterday afternoon you did; yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But even after he gained employment at the Texas School
Book Depository and was being paid he never gave her any money for her to
contribute to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Marina ever express any concern about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Periodically she expressed her embarrassment at having to receive
always from me. I tried to convince her how useful and helpful it was to me to
have her conversation, but I never felt I had convinced her of that. I would have
to say I am guessing that she hoped Lee would contribute. It would have been
like her to think that he should.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You gather that from the fact that she did raise the subject
occasionally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just from the fact that she raised her embarrassment? Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think that is all now. Mr. Jenner, you can use those
to supplement or as you see fit during the interrogation this afternoon. Thank
you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I have no more questions.</p>

<p>I would like to say this though, perhaps, Mrs. Paine, that you understand we
are not trying to punish anybody here. We are <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. This is not a court of law. We are trying to get at the facts.
Anything that you can contribute before you complete your testimony which
would help us to get the facts we would like to receive, whether it be in the form
of hunches or anything that you have, and you must not, I suggest that you don't,
assume that merely because we haven't examined you on a particular fact that
if there is anything that you do have in mind that you advance it and volunteer
it for the benefit of the further security of the country.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have tried very hard to think of the things that I thought would
be useful to you, especially as we had so little time in advance of testifying to
help me recall in thinking about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I say, Mr. McCloy, that Mrs. Paine yesterday and the day
before, when I had an opportunity to talk with her, she did volunteer several
matters of which we had no notice whatsoever. For example, the telephone calls
by Lee Harvey Oswald to her, we had not known of that. And the existence of
the curtain rods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Anything that is in the background that you <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did want to amend my testimony of yesterday in one small
particular. I spoke, indeed, during the testimony I recalled this incident of
Lee having gotten into my car, started it, and did the driving from my home to
the parking lot where we practiced, pretty much over my objection in a sense
but I did not object strongly enough. I said this was about three blocks. That
would appear that it was walking distance. It was longer than that.</p>

<p>If you have someone out there in time, why I could go with the person to show
just exactly what the distance was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What was his reaction when you objected? First, was
your objection just oral, was it strong, was it admonition, of what kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt that, and this is what you are getting at too and I think
something we haven't yet discussed, is the matter of what kind of person this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
was or how I reacted to the kind of person he was. He seemed to me prickly,
all sharp points and edgy, and I wished he could be more relaxed and more at
ease. I didn't want to confront him with a statement of, "Lee, I didn't want
you to start this car and take it yourself", so I simply said, "my father is an
insurance man and he certainly would not want me to be permitting you to drive
in the street when you don't even have a learner's permit yet, and I will certainly
drive it home."</p>

<p>From the time I had first known him he had changed in his attitude toward
me, I felt. I felt in the spring he expected to be disliked, that he carried a shell
of proud disdain around him to protect himself from human contact, and this
was falling away from him at my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the fall you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the fall of the year, in October and November. He began to
appear much more at ease, and as if he had some confidence in how he would be
treated. It is a whole subject really.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you give us a little more information on what you
said to him and what he, or how he responded in this incident involving the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say he clearly wanted to do the driving and to drive in
the street. I felt that this, my not permitting him to, was one of the things that
was helping to get him to the office where he could get a learner's permit, and he
was eager to be driving, and to learn to drive on the street.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he just slough off, so to speak, your admonition that
he shouldn't drive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't make it a requirement that he stop right there so he didn't
have to stop.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You just suggested it might be better?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I just made it clear I was uncomfortable and on the way home I
would drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. There is one thing we haven't had testimony about, I imagine,
except implicitly.</p>

<p>It is alleged that Lee possessed a .38 caliber revolver. Do you, in the light of
hindsight, perhaps, do you have any feeling now that he was secreting that
weapon on your premises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no idea that it was there or ever was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Nothing now makes you feel that it was there other than the
finding of the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Thank you very much, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The Commission will recess until 2 o'clock today.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:20 p.m., the Commission recessed.)</p>

<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will start now. We will continue until Senator Cooper
comes and then he will preside the rest of the afternoon. I will be busy with Mr.
Rankin some of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine, this morning I was seeking to qualify and introduce in evidence
Commission Exhibit 425, which, at the time I had it in my hand, consisted of
one page. You called my attention to the fact that it was a letter dated October
14, 1963, to your mother by you in your handwriting, but that you had only
given me the first page or sheet, which consists front and reverse of two pages.
Then you tendered me the second page or sheet, and indicated some reluctance
about the need for its use in this connection.</p>

<p>During the noon recess you have afforded me the possession of the second page,
and my recollection is you have voiced no objection to its introduction in evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no objection to its introduction. It refers just to personal
matters, but if you don't have it, you will have to wonder what it is. It is better
not to wonder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. And it does give the full context of the really pertinent statements
that you made in the first two pages and to which you made allusion
yesterday in your testimony.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I direct your attention to the second sheet, the first of which is
numbered three and the reverse side numbered four.</p>

<p>Is the handwriting on both of those sheets yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is the third and fourth pages of the letter to which you
referred yesterday and again this morning, Commission Exhibit No. 425?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that page is in the same condition now as when&mdash;that is
pages three and four, as when&mdash;you dispatched the entire letter to your mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I offer Commission Exhibit No. 425 in evidence.
It has been heretofore marked.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibit No. 425 was marked and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There have been marked as Commission's exhibits in this series
451 and 453 to 456, a series of five colored photographs purporting to be photographs
of one Curtis La Verne Crafard, taken on the 28th day of November 1963.
Mrs. Paine would you be good enough to look at each of those, and after you
have looked at them, I wish to ask you a question.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have looked at them all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Calling on your recollection of the physiognomy and appearance
of Lee Oswald, do you detect a resemblance between the man depicted in those
photographs, the exhibit numbers of which I have given, and Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your present recollection, do you recall whether you
have ever seen the person whose features are reflected on those photographs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I have not seen him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. May I see those, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Should I say that one picture in particular struck me as looking
similar to Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. When the Chief Justice has concluded his examination I
will have you pick out that one in particular. Thank you, sir. When you select
it will you give the exhibit number which appears on the reverse side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Exhibit No. 453. Clearly the shoulders are broader than with
Lee, but it is a quality about the face that recalls Oswald to my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the jacket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And the attire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The attire that is shown on the exhibit which is the first one you
have before you, what is the number of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Exhibit 451.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I asked you to describe Lee Oswald, his general attire. Did he
normally wear a zipper jacket of the character shown on that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And referring to the other photographs, you say that man's attire
is similar to that Lee Oswald normally effected and employed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. It certainly is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer Commission Exhibits Nos. 451 and 453 through 456.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibits Nos. 451 and 453 through 456 were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, the Commissioners this morning, had especially directed
questions to you evidencing their interest in FBI interviews.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Senator, will you now continue to preside please, so I will be
free to work with Mr. Rankin a little this afternoon. I will remain here though
for a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I gather the first interview by any FBI agent to your knowledge
was on the first day of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and I don't really think interview is a fully accurate word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What word would you like to use?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt that the agent stopped to see whether the Oswalds, either
Mrs. Oswald or Mr., were living there, and to make the acquaintance of me.
He said that he had talked with my immediate neighbor, Mrs. Roberts, the
previous time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The pronoun you are using refers to the FBI agent.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He, the FBI agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Said that he had inquired of my next door neighbor, Mrs. Roberts,
whether the Oswalds lived here, and she had said that she didn't know the
last name but knew that the wife of the family was living there, and that there
had just been a baby girl born, and that the husband came out some week ends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this what the agent told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, the neighbor told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I judged he wanted to find out directly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you finished?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you subsequently learned the name of the gentleman who
interviewed you or conversed with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have subsequently learned his name, yes. It was James Hosty.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. What was the name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. James Hosty, H-O-S-T-Y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't wish you to give that full interview again because you
touched on it yesterday and again at greater length this morning. But I do
wish to ask you with respect to that interview, did you give Agent Hosty the
telephone numbers that you had received from Lee Oswald as to where he
might be reached in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't. He asked me if I knew where Lee lived. I did
think of these phone numbers, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the course of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At least between that time and the time he came again, but I
have been impressed with what I have now concluded was a mistaken impression
I have which effected my behavior; namely, that the FBI was in possession of
a great deal of information, or so I thought, and certainly would find it very
easy to find out where Lee Oswald was living. I really didn't believe they
didn't know or needed to find out from me. This is a feeling stemming from
my understanding of the difficulties they faced working in a free society. I
would behave quite differently now, but I have learned a lot from this particular
experience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now was there a subsequent interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was an interview a few days later, yes, interview to the
extent that he came to the door, walked in the door. We didn't as much as
sit down. But he asked again about an address. I had none. I did say that
I <span class="locked">expected&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. An address as to where Lee resided?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In town where he resided. I did say that I expected that when
Marina moved into an apartment with Lee again, as we all thought would
occur, that I would be in contact with her, and that I would be perfectly
willing to give him information as to that address when I had such, but that
my contact was with her and therefore through that way I would have the
address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you again interviewed by telephone or otherwise by any
FBI agent prior to November 22, 1963.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have mentioned two times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was all. So up to the time of the assassination, the only
interviews with the FBI to your knowledge were on the first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You will recall your testimony yesterday, Mrs. Paine, of the
incident in which a telephone call was made by you at the request of Marina
using the telephone number that has been left with you by Lee Oswald, and
your inability to locate him, in fact the person who answered the telephone
stated that there was no Lee Oswald living there. Do you recall your testimony
on that score?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you report that to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You also recall your testimony with respect to the draft of the
proposed letter which I think is before you, and that is Commission exhibit
number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 130.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you call the FBI and advise them of that incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And without seeking to have you repeat your testimony, were
your reasons for not doing so the same as the one that you gave when I asked
you whether you had given Agent Hosty the telephone number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; not identical. Certainly I didn't think that they had any
information of such a letter, whereas I did think they knew where he lived or
could easily find out, and of course they could also come to the house and
see him at my house as he came on weekends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did say to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he would be at your home on weekends.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I judged by the fact they didn't come that this was not
someone they were terribly worried about talking to immediately. Both this
letter, and the telephone conversation really, the one that followed it, where
Marina reported to me that he was using a different name, were something new
and different in the situation that made me feel this was a man I hadn't
accurately perceived before.</p>

<p>I have said my impression in reading the letter was&mdash;I have said something
similar to this&mdash;that of a small boy wanting to get in good with the boys,
trying to use words that he thought would please. I didn't know to whom he
addressed himself, but it struck me as something out of Pravda in his terminology.
And I knew, as I have testified, that several of the statements in it
were flatly false, and I wondered about the rest, and then when I heard that
he was using a different name, that again was indication of a great disregard for
truth on the part of Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now what time of day did the interview on November 1 take
place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Late?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Middle of the afternoon. My memory is there were no children
around which means it was nap time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It couldn't have been along about 5 o'clock in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a Friday, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And he probably came out that Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were just telling the agent, you had told the agent, had you
not, that he came on weekends.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he arrived on Fridays?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was a Friday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was, and you will recall <span class="locked">yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did tell the agent that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. It had to have been that session. I know I certainly
told him, and it had to have been that time because the second meeting was
very brief and had only to do with the address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was not on a Friday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said about the agent remaining because Lee
Oswald would be along, he was expected?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. May I interject here to recall to your mind that as I
looked through my calendar trying to find if there was any time, any weekend
other than the weekend of October 12, that Lee arrived on a Saturday instead
of a Friday, it had to be that weekend by deduction. And I don't recall whether
he arrived that Friday evening.</p>

<p>I do recall when he arrived we told him about this meeting and I gave him
the piece of paper on which I had written Mr. Hosty's name and the normal
telephone number for the FBI in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you recall no conversation. May I suggest this to you as
possibly refreshing your recollection. That on that Friday afternoon, which
I may say to you now, Mrs. Paine, is reported by Agent Hosty as having taken
place on November 1, and he has made his report accordingly, was there any
discussion of a suggestion that Lee Oswald would be out that weekend, that
is either that you told him he would not be or that he would be, that you would
expect him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection is that I said he came out here on weekends
and he could be seen then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I have no recollection of ever thinking he was not going
to come that weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have also testified that you were also advised in advance
when he was coming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He asked permission. So if he were coming on the 1st of
November, that very day, you would have been advised in advance that he
was coming, would you not, according to your testimony.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I would think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you don't recall saying anything to Agent Hosty that he
was coming that evening, at least that you expected him to be there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I may have. I don't specifically recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have a recollection that you told him at least generally
that Lee Oswald came to your home on weekends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I feel certain of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, Agent Hosty did not remain?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He did not remain. I don't think it was very close to 5 when he
left. It was earlier in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are inclined to think the interview took place earlier in the
afternoon, that is prior to 5 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; more likely 2 to 3 or 3:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the slumber hours of your children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now you are certain in your own mind that you had no interview
or no FBI agent interviewed you prior to November 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And if an FBI agent did interview you, you were not aware that
you were being interviewed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is absolutely correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection that on October 29, that would be
2 days before the Friday session that you have testified about, that some sales
person or purporting to be a sales person or a drummer or somebody came to
your door and made some inquiries of you about the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. October 29 is a Tuesday. I don't recall any such encounter.
Written on my calendar is "Dal" for Dallas "Junie" meaning we went to a
clinic in Dallas in the morning. It doesn't say about the rest of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now when you reported to Lee Oswald the name of the agent and
the telephone number, you put that on a slip of paper.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And handed the slip of paper to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any conversation between you then as to FBI agents
having at any time prior thereto interviewed Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There may have been. I am certainly clear that I was told
probably by Marina that he had been interviewed, or by both of them, that he
had been interviewed in Fort Worth when they first returned from the Soviet
Union. This I knew before the time of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina say whether she had been interviewed in Fort
Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was only that Lee Oswald had been interviewed at Fort
Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you recall no conversation in which either Lee or Marina
said or intimated to you that they had, either of them had been interviewed
either in New Orleans or in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing was mentioned of having been interviewed in New Orleans
or Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made some reference yesterday, and I want to keep it in
context, to the license number of the FBI agent.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not in testimony. Did I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought you had.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Perhaps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It would be well if we went into that. Would you please recite
what that incident was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am confused by the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the matter of the taking of the agent's license
number from his automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was told by Agent Hosty well after the assassination that they
had found in Oswald's room in Dallas a slip of paper which included not only
Hosty's name and the telephone number of the FBI in Dallas, but also the
license plate number with one letter incorrect, one number incorrect, of the
car that Hosty had driven out. This was the first I had heard anything about
their having been a license plate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not <span class="locked">take&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Number taken down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not take the number down and place it on that piece
of paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or give it to Lee Harvey Oswald or to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not. I was never at any time interested in the license plate
number. I wondered why anyone else would have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, the first you heard of the license number was
after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Under the circumstances you have now related?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I might describe the second meeting with Mr. Hosty a little more
in detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is November 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the only way I can guess as to how this license plate
number was in Oswald's room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Hosty and I, and a second agent was with him, I don't know the
name, stood at the door of my home and talked briefly, as I have already described,
about the address of Oswald in Dallas. Marina was in her room
feeding the baby, or busy some way. She came in just as Hosty and I were
closing the conversation, and I must say we were both surprised at her entering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
He then took his leave immediately, and as he has told me later, drove to
the end of my street which curves and then drove back down Fifth Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now you are reporting something agent Hosty has told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware of the fact that he drove to the end of the
street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not at that time, no. I was aware that he had parked his car
out in front of my house. My best judgment is that the license plate was not
visible, however, while it was parked; not visible from my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I saw the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Parked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I noticed it particularly. Because the first time he had
come on the 1st of November, he had parked down the street, and he made
reference to the fact that they don't like to draw attention for the neighborhood
to any interviews that they make, and in fact my neighbor also commented
when she had talked with him a few days previously that his car was parked
down the street and wasn't in front of my house. So I noticed the change that
he had parked directly in front. But to the best of my recollection, in back
of the Oldsmobile of my husband's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you attempt to look to see what his license number was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you attempt to look at his automobile to see what the license
number was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; nor could I have seen it from my house without my glasses on.
I am nearsighted, and I was not wearing them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But the license plate would have been visible to anybody walking
down the street or who desired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Walking down the street, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or looking out your garage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think so, because to the best of my recollection, an
Oldsmobile that my husband bought was also in front of the house, so that
the cars would have been close at the bumpers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So the license plates would have been screened by the Oldsmobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you given us all you have in mind with respect to the
incidents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is one other thing which is a little different, and I had
forgotten it but it is recalled by our conversation. I have already said that
I said to Agent Hosty that if in the future Marina and Lee are living together, and
I know, or I have correspondence with them I would give him his address if
he wished it. Then it was the next day or that evening or sometime shortly
thereafter Marina said to me while we were doing dishes that she felt their address
was their business. Now my understanding is she doesn't understand
English well. The word in Russian for address is "adres," and she made it plain
that this was a matter of privacy for them. This surprised me. She had never
spoken in this way to me before, and I didn't see that it made any difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did this arise out of, or in connection with, or was it stimulated,
by any discussion between the two of you of the visit of Agent Hosty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So far as I could see, it arose separately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So far as you can recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As far as I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make any effort to obtain Lee Oswald's address so that
you could give it to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. As I have testified, I really thought they had it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you made the telephone call to Lee Oswald and learned
he apparently was living under an alias, and certainly in that weekend immediately
preceding the assassination when the argument occurred between
Marina and Lee Oswald on which he upbraided her for having made the
call, you still weren't activated to call the FBI and tell them that he was
living under an assumed name, is that true?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is true. I did expect to give this copy which I had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
of his "Dear Sirs," letter which you have marked Commission Exhibit 103 to
the FBI agent at the next meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the time he called if he did call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought he would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the interview on November 1, you have testified that
Marina was present some of the time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was present virtually all of that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All of the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And virtually none of the next time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Virtually none.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just came in at the end, on the 5th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she out in the yard? Did you get that impression any time
during that second interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she had to have been in her room the entire time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you firm, reasonably firm that Marina, even if she desired
to learn of the license number on Agent Hosty's car, that she could not have
seen or detected it while remaining in the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She might possibly&mdash;oh, I wouldn't say that. It is conceivable,
depending on where it was parked, it is conceivable that she could have seen
it from the bedroom window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are holding up exhibit number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 430.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are pointing to what on that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The window of the bedroom which she occupied, which is the
southeast bedroom of my house, looks directly out to where I thought the car
was parked. From that position, if I am correct about where the car was
parked, she couldn't have seen the license plate, but she could have seen it if
as Agent Hosty described to me later she saw it while the car was moving along
the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he pulled away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When he pulled away and then he came back and went the other
way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So it is possible that she may have seen the license?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This date that you are now talking about when he parked the
car in front of your house, that was November 5?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whereas on November 1, he parked the car down the street.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. I might add a little more detail here if you want
it. Marina and I talked about whether to tell Lee that the FBI had been out
a second time, and the 5th was a Tuesday. We didn't see Lee until the 8th.
She said to me that he had been upset by the FBI's coming out and inquiring
about him, and he felt it was interference with his family. And I said there
is no reason for him to be upset, or I think conveyed that idea. But the question
of whether to tell him was settled by Marina who told him on Friday evening,
the 8th, and then Lee inquired of me about that meeting, and he said&mdash;I
don't think I have yet said for the record&mdash;he said to me then he felt the FBI
was inhibiting his activities. This is what he said. Has this been said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not yet.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right, I have said it. I said to him "Don't be worried about it.
You have your rights to your views, whether they are popular or not." But I
could see that he didn't take that view but rather was seriously bothered by
their having come out and inquired about him. At this time or another, I don't
recall certainly, I asked whether he was worried about losing his job, and he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say so, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall particularly a telephone conversation with him. On
one of those in which he called out to talk to Marina, I judge, and perhaps she
was busy still changing a baby and I talked. I don't recall the exact circumstances
but I do recall it, and I said to him if his views, not any references now
to the FBI or their interest in him, but if his political views were interfering
with his ability to hold a job, that this might be a matter of interest to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
American Civil Liberties Union, that he should in our country have a right to
unpopular views or any other kind.</p>

<p>This I believe was after he had been to an American Civil Liberties Union
meeting with my husband, that meeting having been October 25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his response?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was pleased, I felt. He felt in a sense reassured. And indeed
I think his response was to join, because it was later reported in the press
that he had, which makes me think that this telephone conversation was quite
close to the time of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. <span class="locked">Paine&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am putting in a lot of guesswork.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Am I interrupting you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. It is just that I wonder if you want me to dredge this deeply
into things I cannot be absolutely certain about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We would like your best recollection. We do hesitate about
speculation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When we are asking about factual matters. We do ask for
your speculation occasionally, but to try to make it quite deliberate when we
are asking for that rather than for facts. Have you now stated all that comes
to mind with respect to the advice to Lee Oswald of the visit of FBI agents or
any discussion with Mr. Oswald at any time while he visited your home during
this period in 1963 prior to November 22 with respect to FBI agent visits?</p>

<p>Have you now exhausted your recollection on the subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think one other thing. Agent Hosty asked me, and I am not
certain which time, but more likely the second, since so far as I can recall
Marina wasn't present, if I thought this was a mental problem, his words
referring to Lee Oswald, and I said I didn't understand the mental processes
of anyone who could espouse the Marxist philosophy, but that this was far
different from saying he was mentally unstable or unable to conduct himself in
normal society.</p>

<p>I did tell Lee that this question had been asked. He gave no reply, but more
a scoffing laugh, hardly voiced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you now exhausted your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have clearly exhausted it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Who asked the question?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Hosty asked the question "Is this a mental problem?"</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you ever hear Oswald express any anger toward either
the agents or the FBI, as an agency?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He expressed distinct irritation that he was being bothered.
That is how he looked upon it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You said that you thought he was concerned about its effect
upon his job, but did he express any emotion other than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And he was being inhibited in what he wanted to do.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Any irritation or anger because they had interviewed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In tone of voice, yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What would it be like?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, irritated. He said, "They are trying to inhibit my
activities."</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he swear at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. He used no language.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he raise the tone of his voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he <span class="locked">show&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing more than an edge to his voice I would say.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he direct it against any individual FBI agent.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he didn't. I have one other recollection that possibly should
be put in regarding the conversation with Agent Hosty the first time when
Marina was present. We discussed many things, just as you would having
coffee in the afternoon with a visitor, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this a discussion between you and Marina with the agent
present or not present.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Discussion between the three of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I can't recall certainly who brought it up, but I think Marina
asked of Hosty what did he think of Castro, and he said, "Well, he reads what
is printed and from the view given in the American newspapers of Castro's activities
and intentions, he certainly didn't like those intentions or actions."</p>

<p>And Marina expressed an opinion subsequently, but contrary, that perhaps
he was not given much chance by the American press, or that the press was
not entirely fair to him. This I translated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the extent of it? Now have you exhausted your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I hope so. I have exhausted myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, do you have another question?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Not on this subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to return to your furnishing of the name and the
telephone number of Agent Hosty. In Commission Exhibit No. 18, which is in
evidence, which was Lee Oswald's diary&mdash;by the way, may I hand the exhibit
to the witness, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is an address book. In any event it is in evidence as
Exhibit No. 18. Have you ever seen that booklet before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Examine the outside of the booklet. Have you seen this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have never seen this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have never seen that in Lee Oswald's possession?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have never seen it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is an entry as follows. Would you help me Mr. Redlich.
Would you read it please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. "November 1, 1963 FBI agent James P. Hosty."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Junior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Just above the word "Hosty" appears in parentheses "RI 1-1121,"
and underneath "James P. Hosty" appears "MU 8605." Underneath that is
"1114 Commerce Street Dallas." I would just like to correct upon the record
that the phone number originally read is "RI-11211."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is that phone number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That phone number I recognize from my own use of it is to the
FBI in Dallas, my use since the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the series of numbers rather than phone numbers, series of
numbers "MU 8605."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is not known to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the system of license plate numbering and lettering
employed in Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not acquainted with any particular system. They use
both letters and numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I call your attention in connection with this entry that it is
dated November 1, 1963, and there does appear in it the license number.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your recollection is firm that you didn't furnish it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. May I point out also that he must have put this down after
November 1st, or at least that evening. He could not have written it down
<span class="locked">with&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It had to be after the fact as you furnished him the name.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the agent's address.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would think he could as well have added&mdash;you don't want my
thinking&mdash;this number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The reason I call that to your attention, Mrs. Paine, it still does
not stimulate your recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any differently than before. You did not furnish the license
number.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I certainly did not. To the best of my recollection I did not put
down the address either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now during the course of that interview of November 5th, did
you not say to Agent Hosty that Lee had visited at your home November 2 and 3?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is entirely possible, likely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in this connection I am at liberty to report to you that
Agent Hosty's report is that you did advise him that Oswald had visited at your
home on November 2 and November 3. Does that serve to refresh your recollection
that you did so advise him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now did you express an opinion to Agent Hosty that Oswald was
"an illogical person?"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I did, in answer to his question was this a mental problem,
as I have just described to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; that is all right. And did you also say to Agent Hosty that
Oswald himself had "Admitted being a Trotskyite Communist."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I doubt seriously I said Trotskyite Communist. I would
think Leninist Communist, but I am not certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember making a remark of similar import?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Reference to Trotsky surprises me. I have come since the assassination
to wonder if he had Trotskyite views. I have become interested in
what such views are since the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your recollection you don't recall making that
comment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wouldn't think that I had the knowledge by which to make
such a statement even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now after this rationalization you have made, Mrs. Paine, it is
your recollection that you did not make such a comment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall. What was the second item that I told Hosty he had
been out on the second and third? I am just trying to clarify here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had told him that Lee Oswald had been at your home November
2 and 3, that you told him that Lee Oswald was an illogical person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And third, that you told him that Oswald had admitted being
a Trotskyite Communist.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I may have said that. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You may have said the latter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is possible that you did say it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is possible. I am surprised, however, by the word at that
point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now do you recall a telephone interview or call by Agent Hosty
on the 27th of January 1964? Perhaps I had better put it this way to you.
Do you recall subsequent telephone calls after the assassination that you received
from Agent Hosty, that you did receive such telephone calls?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did, and visits also, at the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall he called you on the 27th of January 1964 and
that he inquired whether you had given Lee Oswald the license number of his
automobile when he had been at your home? You stated that you had not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>I would have thought that was a face to face interview but I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you also told Agent Hosty on that occasion, "However, this
license number could have easily been observed by Marina Oswald since her bedroom
is located only a short distance from the street where this car would have
been parked."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I doubt I said "easily."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you could have said that the license number could have
been observed by Marina from her bedroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection of this, that it was not a telephone interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Telephone or otherwise, there was an interview of you at which
you made that statement, that Marina could have seen the license?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That Marina could have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do recall the incident. You don't recall whether it was
at your home or whether it was by telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I certainly recall talking with Agent Hosty and on at least one
occasion about how that license number got in Oswald's possession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall a telephone interview by an FBI agent Lee, Ivan D.
Lee on the 28th of December 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The name is not familiar to me. A great many FBI <span class="locked">agents&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall an incident in which you reported to an FBI agent
that you had just talked with a reporter from the Houston Post?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now during the course of that interview, you made reference
to a newspaper reporter, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did. His name is Lonny Hudkins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say that the reporter whom you have now identified
had advised you that Lee Harvey Oswald's mother had been working for a party
in Forth Worth during September and October 1962 as a practical nurse, and
according to the reporter, Mrs. Oswald, mother of Lee Harvey Oswald, advised
this party during her employment that her son was doing important anti-subversive
work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please relate that incident so we will have the facts
insofar as you participated in them stated of record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will. I would not have recalled the date, but I knew it to be
toward the end of 1963. I was called on the telephone by Lonny Hudkins, whom
I had never met, announced himself as from the Houston Post, said there was a
matter of some importance that he wanted to talk with me about, could he
come out to the house? And he then indicated the nature of what he wanted
to talk about to the extent very accurately reported in what you have just read.
I called the FBI really to see if they could advise me in dealing with this man.
It struck me as a very unresponsible thing to print, and I wanted to be able to
convince Hudkins of that fact. I was hopeful that they might be willing to
make a flat denial to him, or in some way prevent the confusion that would have
been caused by his printing this.</p>

<p>Now shall I go on to tell about the encounter which followed with Mr. Hudkins,
and something of that content?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am a little at a loss. Why don't you start because I can't
anticipate.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Whether it is important?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You haven't related this to me. Are these statements you
made to the FBI that you are about to relate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If they asked. I don't recall specifically. I certainly recall
that the content of the telephone conversation reported there is accurate and
is in sum the conversation that then followed with Lonny Hudkins too, except
that it doesn't say what I said in the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you report to the FBI that Mr. Hudkins had said to you
that the primary purpose of seeing you was an effort to get some confirmation
if possible of the possibility Oswald was actually working on behalf of
the United States Government prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was aware that was his purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That you knew of no such situation, and ventured the opinion
to the reporter that the story was wholly unlikely, that you could not imagine
anyone having that much confidence in Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is accurate. I went on to say that Mrs. Oswald, senior,
Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, could well have said to this matron a full year back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and more that her son was doing important anti-subversive work for the government.
This was 1962 he was talking about, but that this was her opinion or
what she may have wished to have true. And I did not consider it terribly
creditable, and said to him "You don't think you have a story here, do you?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You also <span class="locked">recall&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. May I put in another point here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In connection with this subject matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I called and the man to whom I talked, I don't know if it was
Lee, or I think it was someone else who answered first, I am not certain at
all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Odum?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Odum? It certainly was not Odum. I know him. But someone
answered the phone and I told this to him, and perhaps it was Lee. He
said to me in response to my inquiring "What shall I do, here is this man coming,"
he said "well you don't know anything of this nature do you?" I said,
"No".</p>

<p>"Then anything you might have to say is sheer conjecture on the subject?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you should certainly make that plain in talking with him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I certainly did. And I felt as though I really shouldn't
have bothered them. This was not of interest to them. But then I was called
back later by the FBI on the same subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you reported that conversation, the subsequent call back
by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. You have content of the first conversation I think there,
isn't that so, or it might have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There are a series, Mrs. Paine, that run in this order. The first
was on December 28, 1963. The conversation occurred between you and an
Agent Lee, and it was a telephone interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have asked you about that, and I have read from the report
and you have affirmed that you so reported to the agent. And on the next
day, December 29, 1963, you had a telephone conversation, whether you called
or whether the agent called, with Kenneth C. Howe.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Kenneth C. Howe, on this same subject. I have questioned
you about that, and I have read from the report, and you have affirmed as to
that. Then on January 3, 1964, this apparently was an interview at your
home by Agent Odum? Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Agent Odum has been out a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In which you say, did you not, that this reporter Hudkins of
the Houston Post newspaper in his contact with you on the previous Saturday,
December 28 had stated that the FBI was foolish to deny that Agent Joseph
Hosty, being a reference to the FBI agent we have been talking about today,
had tried to develop Lee Harvey Oswald as an informant. You stated you
had made no comment one way or the other to Hudkins regarding this remark,
and furthermore that you knew <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Would you please repeat that, that I stated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will read it all to you then. You advised that Lonny Hudkins,
the reporter of the Houston Post in his contact that he had with you on the
previous Saturday, December 28, 1963, had stated to you that the FBI was
foolish to deny that Agent Hosty had tried to develop Lee Harvey Oswald as
an informant. Did you make that statement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not in just those terms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make the further statement that you made no comment
one way or the other to Hudkins regarding this remark of his to you? In order
to get this in the proper posture, Mrs. <span class="locked">Paine&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you understand the question?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I understand what is said, but it doesn't check strictly with my
recollection, that is the confusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What the agent is reporting is your report of what Lonny Hudkins
had said to you, and your report to the agent of your response to what
Lonny Hudkins had said to you. Do we have it now in the proper posture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is by no means an accurate description of the conversation or
my response.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't have to accept this report, of course, Mrs. Paine. Tell
us what occurred in that interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What you said and what Agent Odum said to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I don't recall that so well. I was going to tell you what I
said to Hudkins. I do recall this, and it may be the foundation for what appears
in your report there. I made no comment on Mr. Hudkins saying that there was
a Joe Hosty, and that this agent had been in contact with Oswald. I observed
that Hudkins had inaccurate information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Didn't you tell the agent what this reporter had said to you that
was inaccurate, to wit, that the reporter had stated to you that the FBI was
foolish to deny that Agent Hosty had tried to develop Lee Harvey Oswald as an
informant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What is totally inaccurate is the following, that implies that I
made no comment to Hudkins regarding such a remark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No please, that has not been suggested. I am trying to take this
chronologically. Did you first report to the agent that Hudkins had said to
you that the FBI was foolish to deny that Agent Joseph Hosty had tried to
develop Lee Harvey Oswald as an informant.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Certainly what Hudkins said was of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you so reported to the agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then did you make the further remark, which is what I think
you are trying to say, that you made no comment one way or the other to
Hudkins when he made that remark, his remark to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I made a great deal of comment and I will say what those comments
were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did to the reporter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the reporter, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please say what you said, and did you report this to the FBI,
Mr. Odum?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Inadequately clearly, judging from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why don't you do it this way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes I reported it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let us have first what you said to the FBI agent on the subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall what I said to the FBI agent. It is much easier
for me to recall what I said to Hudkins. But I do recall clearly that I said to
the FBI agent "I made no correction of his inaccuracies about Hosty's name."
This is where I made no comment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am at a loss now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Joe is not his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. His name is James?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you indicate to the agent that you had raised an issue with
the reporter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He also spelled it with an "i", Hudkins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With respect to the other phase, that is to what the reporter
had said to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would guess that I reported to Mr. Odum other things <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Present recollections Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall the particular conversation with Mr. Odum at all.
I talked with him a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you deny this state to Mr. Hudkins, the reporter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To Mr. Hudkins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say to him that you did not agree with his statement?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To Mr. Hudkins I said many things, which I hoped would convince
him that he had no story, that his information was very shaky, that
Oswald was not in my view a person that would have been hired by the FBI or
by Russia. I said to him "You are the other side of the coin from a Mr. Guy
Richards of the New York Journal-American who is certain that Oswald was
a paid spy for the Soviet Union, and just as inaccurate," and coming to, in my
opinion, and of course I made it clear this was my opinion, to conclusions just
as wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, it was your opinion that Lee Oswald was neither a
Russian agent nor an agent of any agency of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. I said indeed to Mr. Hudkins, I had said to Mr.
Richards that if the so-called great Soviet conspiracy has to rest for its help
upon such inadequate people as Lee Oswald, there is no hope of their achieving
their aims. I said I simply cannot believe that the FBI would find it necessary
to employ such a shaky and inadequate person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that still your view?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you also say to Mr. Odum on that occasion that you knew
that Agent Hosty had not interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you read the statements after they had been written?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What statements?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The statements of the FBI.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no; I have never.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You have never seen them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Never seen anything of it. I knew they must write something,
but I have never seen any of these statements.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You never asked them to show you the statements?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever make a statement to anybody that you can recall
that Lee Harvey Oswald in your opinion was doing underground work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That has never been my opinion. I would be absolutely certain
that he <span class="locked">never&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, did you say it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I would be absolutely certain that I never said such a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To anybody, including when I say anybody, Mrs. Dorothy
Gravitis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely certain. Never said to anyone that I thought Lee was
doing undercover work.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What is that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Gravitis, G-r-a-v-i-t-i-s.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you know this person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She is my Russian tutor in Dallas.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Russian tutor and the mother-in-law of the translator that was at
the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To conclude this <span class="locked">series&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Would you clarify for me, someone is of the opinion that I thought
that Oswald was an undercover agent for whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That you said so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the Russian government.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh. I have certainly never said anything of the sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever say to anybody including Mrs. Gravitis that you
thought Lee Harvey Oswald was a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it is possible I said that. I thought he considered himself a
Communist by ideology, certainly a Marxist. He himself always corrected anyone
who called him a Communist and said he was a Marxist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you use the term communist do you think of a person as a
member of the Communist Party or a native of Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I seldom use the term at all, but I would confine it to people who
were members or considered themselves in support of Communist ideology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A person in your mind may be a Communist, and yet not a member
of the Communist Party, even in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I might use the word in that loose way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The last of these interviews was on, may I suggest, and if not
would you correct me, January 27, 1964, by Agent Wiehl, and Agent Hosty. It
appears, and would you please correct me if I am wrong, to have been an interview
in your home at the very tail end of January 1964?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no specific recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall an interview in which you reported to the FBI,
these two agents, that agent Hosty&mdash;no, that you gave Lee Harvey Oswald the
name of agent James P. Hosty together with the Dallas FBI telephone number
which you had obtained on November 1, 1963, that you did not give him the
license number of the automobile driven by agent Hosty, however, and that,
as I have asked you before, the license number could have been observed by
Marina Oswald on November 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection of the occurrence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it could have been observed on November 5th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you yourself see the license plate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You don't know the numbers or letters that were on the
license plate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, you testified yesterday and you testified again today,
this morning, that you had no recollection of Lee Oswald having gone into the
garage of your home on Thursday, November 21. Do you recall that testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, that I did not see him there or see him go through the door
to the garage. I was clear in my own mind that it was he who had left the
light on, and I tried to describe that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It may have been a possibility and you were inferring from
that that he was in the garage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I definitely infer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you interviewed by the FBI agents Hosty and Abernathy
on the 23d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in the course of that interview, do you recall having stated
to these agents that on the evening of November 21, Lee Oswald went out to
the garage of your home, where he had many of his personal effects stored,
and spent considerable time, apparently rearranging and handling his personal
effects.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall saying exactly that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you have said that to the agents.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I could have said as far as spending considerable time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now that your recollection is possibly further refreshed, please
tell us what you did say to the agents as you now recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You have refreshed nothing. You have got all there was of my
recollection in previous testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Based on the fundamentals, the specifics which you have given
us yesterday and today, you did report to the FBI on the 23d of November
in the interview to which I have called your attention that on the evening
of the 21st Oswald went out to the garage where he had many of his personal
effects stored, and spent considerable time apparently rearranging and handling
his personal effects.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall ever saying "apparently rearranging and handling."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than the word "apparently" that is a reasonable summary
of what you did say to the FBI agents, is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall. I think my best recollection is as I have given
it to you in the testimony, was it this morning, that I certainly was of the
opinion that he had been out there. I had been busy for some time with my
children, and I could easily, and of course that was the day after, and this
several months after, have been of the opinion, been informed as to how long
he had been out there, but my recollection now doesn't give me any length of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have heretofore given us yesterday and today your very best
recollection after full reflection on all the course of events.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I certainly have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I notice that during the course of the interview, and perhaps
you will recall, that you did call attention of the FBI, these two agents, to the
Mexico City letter about which you have testified, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I gave it to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, that is all I intend to cover with respect to the
FBI. Do you have any questions? We will go on to another subject.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. This would be going back into the subject on which you
have already testified, but with reference to this last statement, this letter,
where it is reported, you said, Lee Oswald did go into the garage and spend some
time, did you make a statement to the FBI after the agents had been in the
garage, or the police had been in the garage, and had found the blanket with
nothing in it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, certainly, this was the next day that Hosty was out with
Abernathy.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And you did remember of course that you found the light on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You did not expect it to be on in the garage? Do you think
it is correct then that at the time you made this statement, recognizing the
importance of the garage, that you did say at that time that he had been in the
garage on the night before the President was assassinated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I think I said that.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You think you made that statement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I made that statement. This was certainly my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have already related the arrival of your husband, Michael
Paine, at your home in mid-afternoon of the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now would you please tell me exactly to the best of your recollection
the words of your husband as he walked in the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall his saying anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now his words if any with respect to why he had come.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I asked him before he volunteered. I said something to the
effect of "how did you know to come?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He said he had heard on the radio at work that Lee Oswald was
in custody, and came immediately to the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is what you recall he said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say, and I quote: "I heard where the President was shot,
and I came right over to see if I could be of any help to you."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he also say to you that he "Just walked off the job."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. He said he had come from work. I might interject here
one recollection if you want it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of Michael having telephoned to me after the assassination.
He wanted to know if I had heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he call you before he arrived at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He called. He knew about the assassination. He had been told
by a waitress at lunchtime. I don't know whether he knew any further details,
whether he knew from whence the shots had been fired, but he knew immediately
that I would want to know, and called simply to find out if I knew, and of course
I did, and we didn't converse about it, but I felt the difference between him and
my immediate neighbor to whom I have already referred, Michael was as struck
and grieved as I was, and we shared this over the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his appearance in mid-afternoon, as you have related, was,
according to what he said activated as you have related, that he had heard that
Lee Oswald was now involved.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you and Marina look at the parade, that is as the
motorcade went along were you and <span class="locked">Marina&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was not shown on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, it wasn't?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection they had cameras at the convention
center, whatever it was, that the President was coming to for dinner,
and for his talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was the motorcade being described, broadcast by radio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The motorcade was being described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you and Marina listening to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it was coming through the television set, but it wasn't
being shown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you listening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she show an interest in this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it being broadcast in English, I assume you were doing
some interpreting for her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Most of this has been covered, Senator Cooper, and I am getting
through pages fortunately that we don't have to go over again.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. After you knew that the President was dead, and Marina
knew, do you know, from that time on, whether she ever went into her room,
left you and went into her room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would think it highly likely that she did. The announcement
that the President was actually dead came, oh, I think around 1:30 or close
to 2. I already related that my little girl wept and fell asleep on the sofa.
This was a time therefore that Marina would have been putting Junie to bed
in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Between the time that you heard the President had been
shot and the news came that he died, did she ever leave you and go into her
room, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember specifically, but you must understand that the
little baby was already born. She would have had many occasions, needs to
go into the room.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you know whether she went into the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know whether she went into the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no impressions in that respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall an incident involving Lee Oswald's wedding ring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you relate that, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. One or two FBI agents came to my home, I think Odum was
one of them, and said that Marina had inquired after and wanted Lee's wedding
ring, and he asked me if I had any idea where to look for it. I said I'll
look first in the little tea cup that is from her grandmother, and on top of
the chest of drawers in the bedroom where she had stayed. I looked and it
was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Calling on your recollection of this man, was he in the habit of
wearing his wedding ring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did this strike you as unusual that the wedding ring should
be back in this cup on the dresser in their room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, quite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Elaborate as to why it struck you as unusual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not wear my wedding ring. Marina has on several occasions
said to me she considers that bad luck, not a good thing to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
I would suspect that she would certainly have wanted Lee to wear his wedding
ring, and encouraged him to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In face of the fact that he regularly wore his wedding ring, yet
on this occasion, that is being home the evening before, you received this call,
you went to the bedroom and you found the wedding ring. Did it occur to
you that that might have been in the nature of a leave-taking of some kind by
Lee Oswald, leaving his wedding ring for Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It occurred to me that that might have been a form of thinking
ahead. I had no way of knowing whether or not Marina had known that he
left it. I was not instructed where to look for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But Marina did say to you "would you look for Lee's wedding
ring?"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, Odum did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Odum did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And of course clearly they would know whether he had it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, I see. It was not Marina. It was one of the FBI agents.
And it is your clear recollection that he was in the habit of wearing that
wedding ring all the time. Do you ever recall an occasion when he left the
wedding ring at home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To my knowledge, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you obtained the wedding ring did you examine it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean did you look inside to see if there was an inscription
on it or were you curious about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I gave it to Mr. Odum who was with me in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Odum accompanied you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Went with me to the bedroom. I am pretty sure he was the one.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The morning of the day that the President was killed, did
Mrs. Oswald, after she got up, say anything to you about any unusual characteristics
of Lee Oswald's taking leave of her that morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely none.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did she talk about him leaving? Did she tell you anything
at all about what happened when he did get up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have a recollection that must be from her that she woke
enough to feed the baby, to nurse the baby in the morning, when he was getting
up to go, but she then went back to sleep after that, and she must have told
me that. But that is all I know, that she had been awake, and nursed the
baby early in the morning, and then went back to sleep.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And Lee Oswald went back to sleep?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, no, Marina went back to sleep.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Oh, Marina went back to sleep. Was he leaving then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I judge so.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I judge so.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But I mean did she say anything else about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; nothing about his leaving at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were his habits with respect to breakfast? For example
on the Monday mornings of the weekends which he visited your home, did he
prepare his own, and if so, what kind of a breakfast did he prepare?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say his habit was to have a cup of instant coffee only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have a clear recollection that on the morning of the
21st when you went into the <span class="locked">kitchen&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The 22d, I am sorry, the 22d you saw a plastic coffee cup or tea
cup, and you looked at it and you could see the remains of somebody having
prepared instant coffee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is clear in your mind?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Perfectly clear. I looked especially for traces of Lee having
been up, since I wondered if he might be still sleeping, having overslept.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he in the habit on these weekends of making himself a
sandwich which he would take with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; there is no such habit. Perhaps once Marina prepared
something for him to take with him, I think more for him to put in his room,
partly for lunch, partly for him to have at his room in town and use the
refrigerator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But in any event, on the morning of the 22d you saw no evidence
of there having been an attempt by anybody to prepare?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sandwiches for lunch or to take anything else in the way of
food from your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I saw no evidence, and I saw nothing that was missing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time during all the time you knew the Oswalds, up to
and including November 22, was any mention ever made of any attempt on the
life of Richard Nixon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just that subject matter, was it ever mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your recollection did they ever discuss Richard
Nixon as a person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall Richard Nixon coming into the conversation at any
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to the present day&mdash;well, I want to include the time that
you spoke here a couple weeks ago with Marina, let us say up to and including
that day had there ever been any discussion with you by Marina of the possibility
of Lee Oswald contemplating making an attack upon the person of
Richard Nixon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; no such discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anyone else ever talk to you about that up to that time,
talk to you on that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, after it was rumored in the paper, someone asked me if I
thought there was anything to it but that is something else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say recently some rumor to that effect that is what
you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from your testimony this morning that you have seen
and talked with Robert Oswald but once?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And you recall also when he came to pick up her things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you saw him once for the first time in the city police station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You talked with him on that occasion. You saw him on one
occasion when not so long after that he came out to pick up her things?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had some conversation with him then. Have there ever
been any other occasions that you have had a conversation with him directly
or by telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I made one attempt to have such a conversation and drove
out to his home in Denton and talked with his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what occurred then? When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Possibly in January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of 1964?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you go out there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had been writing letters to Marina and receiving no reply, and
I wanted to go and talk with both Robert and his wife to inquire what was
the best way to be a friend to Marina in this situation, whether it was better to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
write letters or better not to, whether she wanted to hear from me or whether
she didn't, and knowing that they had seen her, I felt they might be able to help
me with this.</p>

<p>I was told by Mrs. Robert Oswald that Robert had a bad cold, and she didn't
want to expose my children who were with me, and she and I talked through
the screen, and I explained what I wanted. But I didn't feel helped by the visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you feel that there was a lack of cordiality?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She apologized for not having me in, and she was friendly and
said, "what nice children you have," but it is somewhat hard to communicate
through a screen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the only difficulty that you observed, the difficulty in
talking through the screen door, the screen of the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt that she could have asked me whether I cared if my
children were exposed. I felt that she preferred for me not to come in.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was Marina staying with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so. I am pretty certain she was at that time at
the Martin's home.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you get any impression in your talk with Mrs. Robert
Oswald that they were not interested in finding out the information that you
were asking for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She offered the opinion that she didn't think there was any
particular point to writing letters at this time, but she offered no reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, do you have copies of those letters, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I know now that I will be to see you on Monday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Are you going to be home on Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am flying Monday morning. Shall we go together? I am not
leaving until Monday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am going down Sunday night. So may I see those letters on
that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As soon as I get home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you be good <span class="locked">enough&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will have to translate them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That will take a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With respect to the curtain-rod package, would you be good
enough to leave it intact, don't touch it, just leave it where it is without touching
it at all.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now you have related to us the Texas School Book Depository employment,
the ability to operate an automobile. I am going to read a list of
names to you, and you stop me every time I read a name that is familiar to you.
There are some of the Russian emigré group in and around Dallas. Some of
them may not be Russian emigré group people, but some of the members of the
staff want these particular persons covered.</p>

<p>George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want also your response that you didn't hear these names
discussed by either Marina or Lee.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have never heard that name discussed by Marina or Lee
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ray.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not hear that name discussed by either of them. I have
since learned from Mrs. Ford that it was to Mrs. Ray's home that Marina went
from Mrs. Ford's home in the fall of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I won't ask you&mdash;well, I have Mr. and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt on
my list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
You have already testified about them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have met them once; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Only on that one occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John and Elena Hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't know them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever hear them discussed by either Marina or Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have never at any time heard that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I think I pronounce this correctly, Tatiana Biggers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not familiar with that name, and I never heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Teofil Meller?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not familiar with that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lydia Dymitruk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I met a Lydia who was working as a clerk at a grocery store in
Irving, and I had met Marina previously. I am not certain of her last name.
I am certain that Marina told me not to learn Russian from her, it was not
grammatical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>By the way, did Marina go out by herself occasionally and shop?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Daniel F. Sullivan?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Alan A. Jackson III?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I know that name; yes. That name was mentioned by, to the
best of my recollection first in my presence by, Marguerite Oswald, who told us
that she had just started at the police when I first met <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like that. The first time there came to your attention
and your consciousness the name Peter Gregory was when Marguerite Oswald
mentioned it at the police station on the 22d of November 1963, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; because she had just begun a course of study with him in
order to try to learn the Russian language at the public library.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She so said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She so said. I don't recall having heard the name previously.
Although I am not certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Paul Gregory.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would be absolutely certain I had never heard the name from
either of the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Is that likewise true of Paul Gregory who is the son
I may tell you of Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not familiar with that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. and Mrs., I know you are familiar with this name, Mr. and
Mrs. Declan Ford. When did you first hear of the name of those people with
respect to November 22, 1963, before or after or on that very day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Mrs. Ford was mentioned to me by name by Marina in the fall
of 1963 before the time of the assassination. Marina described to me a party
at Mrs. Ford's home, and described the decor of the house and how much she
admired Mrs. Ford's tastes, and said that Mrs. Ford had done most of the
decorating herself.</p>

<p>Let me just say Marina also told me she had stayed at someone's home in the
fall of 1962, but she did not tell me the name of Mrs. Ford in that connection.
It came up in this other connection. It is only since the assassination that I
learned she had stayed briefly at Mrs. Ford's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>That is the extent of your information with respect to the Fords at least up
to November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Up to the time of the assassination that is the extent of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish to be certain of this and I don't recall whether I asked
you and, therefore, I will risk repetition.</p>

<p>Did Marina and Lee, with you or even without you, visit any people, to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
knowledge, while Marina was living with you in the fall of 1963, just social
visit, go out and make a social visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I meant to include whether either together as a couple or
separately.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall no such visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think your testimony was when Lee Oswald came home on the
weekends, from what you have described he remained on the premises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With the possible exception of one instance when he went off and
bought some groceries or am I wrong about that exception?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He went with my children to buy some popsicles while I was
teaching a student, so I was not at home that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>We have a report, Mrs. Paine, and you might help us with it on this subject,
of a barber in your community, who recounts to the FBI that in his opinion
Lee Harvey Oswald or what he thinks a gentleman who was that man, came to
his shop reasonably regularly and had a haircut on Saturday, on Saturdays, and
accompanying him was what he judged to be a 14-year-old boy. Do you recall
Lee Oswald ever obtaining a haircut over any weekend while he was at your
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your recollection, subject to his being off the
premises while you were away shopping, it is your present firm recollection he
never left the premises once he arrived, save this one instance that you knew of
when he went to get popsicles?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of course, I was away during that instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you anticipated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Now, the morning of the 11th of November I was not home
from something before 9 o'clock until about 2 that afternoon. I don't know
what transpired during that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there other occasions when you were off ministering to your
children, that is taking them to the dentist or something of that nature, on a
Saturday or to church on Sunday or to the local park on Sunday, that Lee
Oswald may have been, that is periods of time when you would not have known
whether he was on or off your premises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can think only of grocery shopping which would have been
an hour to an hour and a half period, and the two times that I can recall in
the Saturday afternoon, on a Saturday afternoon that I went to Dallas to teach
one Russian student a lesson. I can't think of any other spaces of time, hours
that I was away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this gentleman also <span class="locked">says&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Except the one I have just mentioned, of course, the one of
November 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He also says that the man he thinks was Lee Harvey Oswald not
only regularly came to his shop on Friday evenings or Saturday mornings for
a haircut, but that he occasionally drove a station wagon.</p>

<p>Do you know of any occasion to your certain knowledge that Lee drove your
station wagon other than the one occasion you have already related?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether Lee Oswald subscribed to any newspapers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What newspapers, excuse me, did he or did he not subscribe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. They came to my door. They sat around the house until
the weekend when he arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us what newspapers those were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I noticed a paper which I was told was from Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In Russian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see it in the sense of glancing at it out of idle
curiosity if nothing else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there something about it that indicated to you that it came
from Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She told you. Was it a political tract or was it a newspaper
as we understand newspapers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a newspaper as Russians understand newspapers which
makes it a borderline political tract.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>In addition to that Russian newspaper from Minsk was there <span class="locked">anything&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was a Russian magazine, small, Reader's Digest size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The witness is indicating in her hands about a page size of
about nine <span class="locked">by&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nine by six.</p>

<p>Is that about the size?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Something like that, called the Agitator, the name written in
Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The word "Agitator" was written in Russian, printed in
Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the face or cover page of this document, is that true?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the entire document in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion to look at it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just the outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your curiosity or intellectual interest never went beyond reading
any portion of one of the issues?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do recall definitely the title page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Crocodile, which is a Russian satirical humor magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion to read it and to observe Russian humor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not political in character?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Being satirical, of course, it made political reference but it was
not particularly political in nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not designed as a political tract, put it that way.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. The Russian magazine Ogonok.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What does that mean in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It means "bonfire" or "fire".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that printed in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have&mdash;did your curiosity lead you to read any portion
of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or it may be&mdash;let's see, I am not certain in my translation,
but go ahead with the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are not certain of your translation of the word?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of that single word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the title of this document about which you are now speaking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you think it means what you said it meant?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It has something to do with fire; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you read any portion of any of those issues?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the nature of it with respect to whether it was
political or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was not political.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was its nature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Narrative, special articles of interest to the general population.
Marina enjoyed reading this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She enjoyed it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She expressed herself as disliking the Agitator. She interpreted
some of the things in Crocodile for me which I had difficulty understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. He subscribed to Time magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he read it when he come out on weekends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he did. He read that first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sat down and read that first.</p>

<p>Did he take the issue away with him when he left every week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is my impression he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are there any others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. He subscribed to the Militant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Militant. What is the Militant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a paper in English, newspaper style and I would say these
next <span class="locked">two&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Published by whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Socialist Worker's Party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have been so told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just don't know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But was it a political tract?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you read it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why didn't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wasn't interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because of the nature of the document?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If I had had time to do much reading, I might have taken an
interest but I had no time, insufficient time to do the reading I really wanted
to do. He also subscribed to the Worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the publication of the Communist Party USA?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have been told so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you read that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you observe&mdash;have you now concluded the list of newspapers,
periodicals or magazines to which he was a subscriber?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe so. I might say that my awareness of his subscribing
to these last two, the Militant and the Worker, came after the assassination.
There was mail awaiting for him for that weekend which he did not pick up
on the 21st, and after the assassination, indeed, after Saturday evening, the
23d, when it was announced on television that they had a photograph of Lee
Oswald holding two papers. I looked at this pile of mail waiting for him which
consisted of these two newspapers, the Militant and the Worker, and I threw
them away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You threw them away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Without opening them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you throw them away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was pleased to throw away anything I could. I just didn't
want it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, my question or query, and I think expression of surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
is activated by what I am about to ask you as to whether you might call that
to the attention of the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I am sure they knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How are you sure they knew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Because mail stopped coming on the spot, nothing came after
the assassination, I was certain it was still coming to some place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But this was almost instantaneously after you heard a broadcast
that a photograph of him had been found in which he had been holding
up the Militant.</p>

<p>But you immediately went to see if he had that mail and there was a copy
of the Militant and you threw it away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it occurred to me you might have called the FBI's attention
to the fact that it had come to the house. But you didn't in any event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you report it to the FBI in any of these interviews you had
subsequently with them, or did they ask? It is two questions, if you will
answer both.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If so, it was quite recently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did the other papers begin to arrive? Did I interrupt you
before you had a chance to complete your answer to my question?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The papers different from the Worker and the Militant, when did
they begin to arrive at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, they began to arrive, I would say, some time after October
4th. That is, of course, my judgment. That is a rationalization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These magazines and newspapers you have recounted first appeared
at your home after Lee Oswald came to Dallas and became employed or
came to Dallas to live at your house and to seek employment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He came to Dallas, he lived in Dallas, but he used my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He came to your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As a residence, mailing address. Never asked to and I never
complained but I noticed, of course, that he was using it as a mailing address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to that time and even though Marina was living with you
nothing of that nature came to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prior to the time that Lee arrived at your home on or about or
on the 4th of October 1963, none of these newspapers or periodicals had come
to your home, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he a reader of the local newspaper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were a subscriber to what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the Irving newspaper and the Sunday Dallas Morning News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he read both of those?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was very interested in seeing the Sunday paper edition especially.
He read both, to the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He also read the daily papers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, he wasn't there daily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he was there he read it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The Irving paper didn't come out on Saturday, so it was only the
Sunday papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But there were occasions when you had issues, the Friday issue
around or Thursday issue around your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall his being interested in back issues.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are there any letters and communications between you and
Marina or between you and Lee Oswald to which you have not called my
attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There never were any letters of any sort between me and Lee
Oswald except unless you could include this English portion to which I have
already called your attention in a letter to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The only other letters&mdash;I have called your attention to all such
letters, but I will have to wait until you are in Dallas to see the letters written
since the assassination to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then I will ask you this question.</p>

<p>You produced for my inspection all of these letters other than the ones that
I will see when I am in Dallas which you have identified as having been written
subsequent to, subsequently to, November 22, 1963, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right, you have all the correspondence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Wait, we did omit one letter which you have from Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I have it here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You have no gaps that I could supply you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I appreciate the fact I have that letter which we found not
relevant and, therefore, I did not tender it. You have tendered to me everything
other than those I will see when I reach Dallas.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do you recall having a conversation with Dr. Froelich
<span class="locked">Rainey&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask, just a moment, the letter which has not been
tendered and which was said not to be <span class="locked">relevant&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You have a copy of it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. To whom was that letter addressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is addressed to Marina.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask, does counsel have a copy of that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I have a copy of the letter and I have preserved the original
and I also have a typewritten copy.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. It has not been offered as part of evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It has not been offered because it is irrelevant to anything referred
to here and it also has a personal remark in it that Mrs. Paine would
prefer not to have spread on the record.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A remark not pertinent to the assassination or to the Oswalds
but to my marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the <span class="locked">name&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Let me just say for the record I think that will have to be
a matter which will have to be considered by the members of the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>The letter to which you have reference you have exhibited to me, it is in your
handwriting and it is in the same condition now as it was, a copy of a letter as
I recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Which letter are you referring to?</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. On the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will do some jumping around because we have some tag ends
to cover, I hope in a hurry.</p>

<p>You left New Orleans on September 23, was that in the morning or afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was early morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Early morning.</p>

<p>Did you drive right straight through to Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You stopped then the evening of September 23, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where, in Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was just over the line into Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember the name of the town?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you pay for that lodging?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, was there ever any financial arrangement agreed on
with respect to Marina's stay with you in the fall of 1963 which would involve
your giving her $10 a week or any other sum?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; nothing was said beyond this attempt in the letter that I made
to make her feel that she would not be having to ask for every need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have those letters now in evidence and you testified about
them yesterday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Returning your attention to the time that Mr. Oswald, Lee
Oswald, came to Irving in October of 1963, that is October 4, and reported to you
he hitchhiked, you recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He remained overnight the night of the 4th of October, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he return to Dallas the following day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he driven back to Dallas within the next couple of days
by you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection is that I took him to the bus station around noon
on the 7th of October, that is a Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not drive him all the way into downtown Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina has testified, or at least when interviewed by the FBI
stated, that you did drive Lee to downtown Dallas.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have given you all my recollections on this matter, haven't I, for
the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. <span class="locked">With&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even after further reflection last night your recollection is as
you have already stated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That there was an occasion that we were going in with a Russian
typewriter on an errand of mine to get that fixed, and I drove him to Ross Street
and some crossroad, and he said was near to the employment office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>What occasion was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Day, yes; please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall but I would be fairly certain it was a Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had he been out at your home over the weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it after he had become employed with the Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he was on his way to the employment office. This was his
purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So it was sometime prior to the weekend, was it, that the matter
of employment by the Texas Book Depository had arisen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would judge that it has to have been on the 14th, which was
Monday prior and indeed morning prior to the conversation at Mrs. Roberts
about this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But I may be wrong about that, but it is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the conversation at Mrs. Roberts take place on the 15th of
October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; on the 14th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the 14th. That was what day of the week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you drive him into Dallas on that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't think when else it could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to the best of your recollection that is probably the day then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you indicate&mdash;did Marina accompany you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she or you indicate any interest in driving by and seeing his
apartment or room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion at any time, Mrs. Paine, in your home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
or otherwise, with Marina or with Lee, as to the appearance of his rooming
house, curtains flooring, what it was like?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The only thing I recall is that he described it as more comfortable
than the $7 room he had occupied, told me the cost of it, said that he could watch
television and had privileges to use the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But other than that he didn't describe it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there ever any discussion of any need on his part for curtains,
that he liked to brighten up his room or in any respect, any additional appointments?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no such conversation at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are acquainted with Dr. Froelich Rainey?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is&mdash;what is his position with the University of Pennsylvania.
He has a position with the University of Pennsylvania Music Department, has he
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He is the curator, the head man, as I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are acquainted with his wife Penelope?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does Penelope speak Russian fluently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She has a very good command of the language. I think she has
not had very much opportunity to use it in speech.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you had occasion to inquire of Mrs. Rainey as to whether
she might assist you with your Russian studies?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, there was never any discussion of assisting me in the role of
tutor. She did some years ago loan me a record which I taped that was in Russian,
and we visited this fall as part of my trip in the east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean, summer, not fall.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it was, yes, August probably or early September that I saw
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do recall during the course of your summer trip before
you went, that is you wound up in New Orleans from that trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So we are talking about the same trip.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the same trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did see her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where in Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At her home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is her home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Her home is not far from the residence where I was staying in
Paoli. It is suburban Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion then to report to her that&mdash;about Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And advise her in that respect, that she was married to an American
who is now residing in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say to her that the, I will call the, lady, Marina, but it
is stated differently here, appeared to be having marital difficulties with her
husband.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you state what your remarks were to Mrs. Rainey in
that connection? That is the treatment of Marina by Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall exactly what I said as to the treatment, but that
Marina was unhappy, and that I thought she should have some alternative to
living with him, and that I would probably, when down there, offer for her to live
at my home. She asked me what Michael thought of that, and I said we had
discussed it but that Michael and I were not living together, and this was news
to Mrs. Rainey, and concerned her deeply.</p>

<p>And I said that I was lonely. I recall one important thing in what I said to
Mrs. Rainey, that I never said in conversation to anyone else, that I was worried
about offending Lee, that if offended, or if he felt I was taking his wife or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
doing what he wanted in the situation, that he might be angry with me, and that
I didn't want to subject myself or my children to possible harm from him.</p>

<p>She is the only person to whom I mentioned my thought that he might possibly
be a person who could cause harm, and there was a very, not a strong thought
in my thinking at all, but should be registered as having at least occurred to me,
that he could be angry to the point of violence in relation to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the point of physical violence in relation to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In relation to me in this situation and I wanted to be perfectly
sure before I made any offer definite that he was not, in fact, angry at my offer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall visiting your sister Sylvia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were there about 3 days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you discuss Marina when you were with your sister?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in substance did you say to your sister that you intended to go
to New Orleans in the course of your trip within about 2 weeks to pick up Marina
who was pregnant, she was the wife of an American, and she was to live with
you in your home in Texas?</p>

<p>Did you say that much to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I probably said it depended on whether she wanted to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that have I stated the substance in that connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you also say to her that Marina wanted to leave her husband
who was not supporting her, and was a jerk as far as his husband's role was
concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not.</p>

<p>What did you say, did you say anything of similar import?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Similar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, you did imply to your sister, did you, that Marina
wished to leave Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I would guess that was her interpretation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say in this connection, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, did you say, did you express your personal opinion to
your sister as to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say in that connection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My opinion of Lee Oswald was quite negative all the way up
<span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is what you have told your sister now, that is what I want.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall exactly what I told my sister at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I talked with virtually everyone I saw this summer, and there
were a great many people, about this friend because it was important to me.
I have already testified that I thought Lee didn't care enough about his wife
and wasn't being a proper husband in the spring and through the summer,
therefore, and it wasn't until I was in New Orleans that I thought he cared
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am just confining myself to this period. During this period
as you visited your friends you did have occasion to express a negative opinion
on your part with respect to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It might have been more or less forceful in that expression of
your opinion depending on the person with whom or to whom you were talking.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say that my sister's reaction to what I said was more
forceful than what I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did express a negative opinion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You testified that&mdash;are you acquainted with a Dr. Carl Hyde?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He is my brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you discuss Marina and Lee with him when you visited
there in September of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall particularly an evening discussion with his wife where
I told quite a lot about the contact that I had had with Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you state to either or both of them that Marina's husband
was a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is possible. I think it is more likely that I referred to
him as a Marxist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what is the distinction between a Marxist and a Communist
in your mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Distinction is not clear to me, but I judged that Lee felt there
was a distinction as <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression as to what Lee thought a Marxist
was as distinguished from a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no clear impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If I suggested the possibility of, that a Marxist tenet was the
change in government by violent means rather than gradual process?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is not something I ever heard from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it anything that you ever thought of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A concept that you ever had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In describing Marxism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever discuss with Lee why he was&mdash;he always took care
to distinguish to say that he was a Marxist as distinguished from a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you form an impression as to what he intended to convey
by that description?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He intended to convey that he was more pure, I felt, that was
my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. More pure than what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Than a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you also say to your brother or your sister or both of them
that Lee had not permitted her to learn English, that is Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that Marina was experiencing marital difficulties with Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever say that Marina did not share her husband's
political views?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, that is to your brother or sister or both of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Speaking of the marital difficulties, did you ever have the feeling
that Marina was in some measure a contribution&mdash;contributed toward those,
causing those difficulties or a catalyst from which those difficulties resulted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't have that feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not.</p>

<p>What feeling did you have in that direction, assuming you had one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All the time I knew her or at least any references from her of
the matter to their marriage left me with the impression that it was hopeful
that though it was difficult they could work out their difficulties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that she was desirous of attempting to do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was desirous of attempting to do so though still leaving
open the possibility that in time she would have to conclude that she couldn't.</p>

<p>She by no means simply gave in to him on every point or let him walk on her,
but that, I would say, is a healthy thing for the marriage rather than anything
contributive to any fundamental difficulty in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you completed your answer?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did Marina ever indicate to you in any way whether or not
she felt, after she came to the United States and saw Lee Oswald in his country
in which he had been born and reared, that she found him unintelligent or a
person of mean ability, small ability or poor background?</p>

<p>Did she ever have any comment in any way on his being inferior?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall her ever commenting in that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she disappointed in any way after he returned to the United
States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall her ever saying that.</p>

<p>I had heard Mrs. Ford express such an opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be hearsay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That would be hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know, are you familiar with the report that appeared
in the Fort Worth Press on January 15, 1964, reporting that you had told
Marvin Lane that Lee could not have taken the rifle from your garage and gone
to practice without your knowledge?</p>

<p>Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mark Lane.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is Mark but that perhaps was in the Fort Worth Press. I
recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever make that statement to a reporter for the Fort
Worth Press?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I did; with slight variation. It always came out a more
definite statement in the press than I meant to make it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say to the reporter then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said I did not see how he could have taken the gun from the
garage without my knowing it. There were two weekends particularly in question
which had been reported in the Press that someone had seen him at a firing
range, one being the weekend of the 9th and 10th, and I was home virtually all
of that weekend except Monday the 11th as I have already described.</p>

<p>The other being the following weekend, and I didn't see how he could have&mdash;the
weekend he was not out at my house, I didn't see how he could have come
out, taken the gun, gone away without my knowledge, and if the gun had not
been in that garage that weekend, I didn't see what the purpose of his coming
out the 21st of November was in the situation.</p>

<p>And this is what I told Mr. Tackett of the Fort Worth Press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you also tell Mr. Tackett in addition to, that his reasons
for his not engaging in rifle practice that weekend or any other weekend was
that he couldn't drive an automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And also that he couldn't have walked that far for rifle practice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. By that far I mean there is no place you can walk to
from my house, not only not to the firing range, but to an open enough place
where you could fire. It would be difficult to walk that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was the firing range at which it was suggested he practiced?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know exactly. It was in the Grand Prairie area, just
south of where we are located. But it would be a 15-minute car drive I would
expect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your home to the firing range. Do you know, did you
ever go to the firing range to see where it really was located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are relying on the newspapers, are you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say thinking of its location you are thinking of the
general location of Grand Prairie, Tex.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were you asked to give your opinion on that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Why would you submit that as your conclusion that he
could not have taken the rifle away, could not have got to a firing range?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The only thing&mdash;well&mdash;it had been reported in the press that he
had been seen at a firing range or someone said he had seen him, Oswald, at a
firing range on the weekend of the 9th, 10th, and the following weekend and it
seemed to me important to say what I could on the subject if I had any contrary
information, and I did any time the reporters asked me about it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When you made a statement about the rifle, were you considering
the fact that he had left your house on the morning of the 21st before
you got up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't understand the question.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The 22d, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Let me say in making such a statement to the Press, I was not
implying that I didn't think Oswald had taken a gun from my house on the
morning of the 22d. Now, you ask the question again and perhaps I will understand
it better.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were you referring to two weekends when he left your house
in saying that he couldn't take the gun or were you including also the morning
of the 22d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was definitely not including the morning of the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I proceed, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know of any occasion when Lee and Marina did or might
have visited the welfare office of the Salvation Army on your return from
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having in mind all your contact with them during that period,
do you have an opinion as to whether that could have taken place, that they did
visit the Salvation Army Welfare Office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was suggested that this was in the fall of the year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know of any time that they could have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall in your discussion with Mr. Randle when the matter
of the Texas School Book Depository possible employment came up, did you
make a statement to Mrs. Randle suggesting that she not mention to anyone
that Marina was of Russian birth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. After he had been hired I told Mrs. Randle that Lee was worried
about losing his job, and asked her if she would mention to Wesley that he
was worried about this, and would prefer for it not to be talked about where he
worked, that he had a Russian wife as that would, therefore, bring up the
subject of his having been in Russia and, therefore, the subject of his having
tried to change his citizenship there, and she said to me oh, she was certain that
Wesley would not talk about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the extent of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And its thrust, rather than the cryptic thrust I have given it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know a Frank Krystinik?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is an associate of your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion to say to him at any time that Lee Oswald
was not properly taking care of his wife and children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I could well have given him that impression or given him that
impression through Michael. I didn't very often see Frank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you could have made that remark to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made similar remarks to others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the time you visited with your mother-in-law, Mrs.
Young, did you say to her that Lee wished his wife to return to Russia alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I very probably did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And also that he did not wish his wife to learn to speak English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would judge that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that Marina did not wish to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. While you are getting your papers together can I ask a few
questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I refer to November 22 when the police came and you and
Marina went into the garage with the police, you testified about that. Then
you discovered that there wasn't anything in the blanket.</p>

<p>Now, at a later time, I believe you testified that the police showed Marina
a rifle and asked her if she could identify this rifle that she had seen in Lee's
possession.</p>

<p>What did she say about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said that her husband's rifle had been a dark gun, that she
was not certain that that was the one. That she could not absolutely recall
whether there had been a telescopic sight on his gun or not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was she speaking in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were you translating?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, Mr. Mamantov.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were you following what she said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; indeed.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How did she designate the sight? What words?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a Russian word that sounded to me like binocular, as I recall.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did she refer to it as a sighting device not in the words
sighting device, but did her language in substance as she described it give reference
to it as a sight on the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My judgment is that Mr. Mamantov used the word in reference
to it first, you see, and then she simply used the same word.</p>

<p>Asking her was she acquainted with this, and giving the word in Russian,
and she said she wasn't certain she had seen that binocular or whatever the
word used was on the gun.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Now, at any time on the 22d, after she had admitted that
she had seen a rifle before, and in your talk with her, either on the way into
the police station or any other time, did she say anything more about having
seen the rifle before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she didn't.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. To you? What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you know who brought Lee Oswald to your house from
Dallas when he would come for his visits?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. After he had gotten his job it was my understanding that he
came with Wesley Frazier.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you ever hear him say that anyone else brought him
to your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he ever say that any fellow worker at the Depository
brought him to the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Other than Wesley Frazier; no.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he ever mention by name or any description any of the
people with whom he worked at the Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Except for Wesley; no.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. He never mentioned any one of his fellow workers, associates
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he ever refer to them in any way as liking or disliking
them as a group or as individuals?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. In your talks with him or in hearing him talk did he ever
refer to any persons who were friends of his or associates?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never heard him mention anyone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. He never mentioned the name of any person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not anyone. He mentioned a friend in Houston as I have
already testified, no name and I was wondering whether there was any such
friend, I recall that. That is absolutely the only reference I can recall.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You said that you told someone that Marina did not agree
with his political views?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She told me she wasn't interested in politics. She told me indeed
that Lee complained about her lack of interest.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is something different from saying that she didn't
agree with them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, she did say that she didn't like his having passed out
leaflets in New Orleans. This is still different from saying she disagreed,
though. But that is the most I can say.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did she ever tell her what her political views were, if any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said she didn't consider herself a person interested in
politics. <span class="locked">She&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did she ever refer to Lee being a Marxist or a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall such a reference ever.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did she ever tell you whether or not she was a Marxist or
a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I assumed she was not either.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I assumed she was not either. She did at one point poke fun
at the Party faithful who attended a Young Communist meeting in Minsk, whom
she considered a dull lot and the meetings quite dull.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I missed the early part of your testimony so you may have
testified to this, but I thought that I recalled that you did answer a question
addressed to you by someone, a member of the Commission or counsel, in which
you said that you were attracted to the Oswalds when you first met them, one,
because you wanted to perfect your own Russian, and did you say, too, that
you were interested because of the fact that he had been a defector and had
returned and it was an unusual circumstance which interested you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It made him an odd person.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It made him an odd person. I was interested in the curious
sense of what could have motivated him to do this.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Having that interest, didn't you ever talk to him about it,
inquire about his experience?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I guess I wasn't interested enough.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What led him to do it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And as I have already testified he always wanted to speak Russian
to me, which shortens my tongue. I can't say as much or raise as many
questions.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Well, did you try to search out the reasons for his defection
and the reasons for returning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And his political views, his economic views, that kind of
thing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I regret now that I didn't take any interest, but I did not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You said that, in answer to counsel that, you either did
tell people or probably told them that you believed Lee Oswald was a Communist.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is my impression I spoke of him as he spoke of himself as
a Marxist.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And you think, you believe, that has some relationship to
communism?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh; yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think you have stated that you didn't believe it was necessary
for a person to actually be a member of the Communist Party to be
a Communist in his views?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. But that I considered it something less than actually
accurate to call such a person a Communist that went on <span class="locked">being&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Other than the persons you have named in your testimony
as having come to your house, was there anyone else who ever came to your
house, who talked to Lee Oswald or Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall no one other than the people I have mentioned, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Knowing that he was as you have described in your own
words, a Marxist, were you concerned at all about that or worried about that,
as being in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, as I have described in testimony, I asked myself whether
or not he might be a spy. I was not at all worried about ideology contrary
to my own or with which I disagreed, and it looked to me that he was a person
of this ideology or philosophy which he calls Marxism, indeed nearly a religion.</p>

<p>But not that he was in any way dangerous because of these beliefs.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Thinking now and then that he might be a spy or in the
employ of the Soviet Union, were you concerned about the fact that such person
who might be a spy or an agent of the Soviet Union was living in your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, if you recall my testimony I concluded that he was not,
and also I was pleased that the FBI had come and I felt that they would worry
about that, and that I didn't need to worry about any risk to me of public
censure for my befriending such a person.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You told about the newspapers and periodicals that he received
and read.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he also have any books that he read while he was at
your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall his reading books while he was at my house. He
watched television a great deal but I don't recall his reading books.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You said that he did not have very ample means, financial
means.</p>

<p>Were you struck with the fact that he was able to have these newspapers
sent to him from Russia, England, New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I <span class="locked">observed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The Communist Worker comes from New York.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, nothing from England, I recall, but he certainly considered
these valuable. He was willing to spend money on these, I observed that,
yes. It was rather unusual or unlike the rest of his behavior in that he did
spend money for these periodicals.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you ever lend any money to either Marina or Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever give them any money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Cash money; no.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Cash; no.</p>

<p>Of course, I bought groceries but that is not what you are asking.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You gave no money in the sense that you turned over physical
possession of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. To either Lee or Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; not at any time to either one.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You did help them in the sense that you provided a home
for Marina and on occasion provided food for Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I have just one or two more.</p>

<p>You said at one time you came to the conclusion that he wasn't an agent or
spy because you didn't think he was intelligent enough.</p>

<p>I believe you said that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That and the fact that as far as I could see had no contacts
or any means of getting any information that would have been of any interest
to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yet he was intelligent enough that he had learned to speak
Russian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His Russian was poor. His vocabulary was large, his grammar
never was good.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You said that he had, I believe, had the initiative to go
to Russia, not as a tourist but as for reasons that he had developed himself,
and that he came back when he made up his mind to come and was able to bring
his wife.</p>

<p>You knew he moved around rather quickly, didn't you? He was in New
<span class="locked">Orleans&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In this country?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I knew he had been in Fort Worth and had come to Dallas
to seek work and then losing work had gone back to New Orleans and then
back to Dallas.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What made you willing to have this man, you have said, this
very curious man, from all you have described about him, to have him in
your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was Marina's husband and I like her, and I, as I have
described, was both lonely and interested in learning the Russian language. I
would have been happy had he never come out, indeed happier had he not
come out on the weekends.</p>

<p>But they were not separated as a married couple nor contemplating such
separation, and I didn't feel that this&mdash;it was appropriate for him to have to
stay away. I did not ask that.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Prior to the time that Marina left your home&mdash;the day of
the assassination, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She left the next day.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The next day.</p>

<p>Had you and Marina ever had any disputes or quarrels between yourselves?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have referred to just one time when she in a sense was taking
me to task on the matter of whose property their address was, I just mentioned
that, that is the only time I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the incident in which <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Following the November 5th meeting with Mr. Hosty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Hosty.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You had said that, I believe you said, prior to the assassination
you considered Lee Oswald as being violent or dangerous?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, now I have said that the thought crossed my mind once in
relation to myself.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What caused that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That he might be violent, because I thought he might resent my
stepping in to do for his wife what he was not doing.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What made you think he would be violent about it if he wasn't
caring about taking care of her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I wanted to satisfy myself, and I did then. The thought
crossed my mind before I went to New Orleans for the second time as I have
referred to it in a conversation with Mr. Rainey, before I went to New Orleans
and then seeing him and changing my opinion some about him, I felt that he
would not be violent or angry with me for this offer, and then proceeded with it,
and this is the <span class="locked">only&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I can understand why a person might be angry about something.
But what about him led you to believe that he might be violent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was nothing that I could put my finger on. On the
contrary my general impression was not of a man who would break out in
sudden marked violence. He argued with his wife, and was distinctly unpleasant
with her.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I believe you said the other day in answer to a question by
Congressman Boggs that you held the opinion now that he did fire the rifle at the
President.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I believe that is so but I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. From this vantage point, is there anything about him now
which you think of which seems consistent with the fact that he, that you
believe he did shoot the President, President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, what has led me to the conclusion that he did shoot President
Kennedy is the massive circumstantial evidence that surrounds his relationship
or where he was, what he had at the time of the assassination. Perhaps
we should get into the matter of motive.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. In other words, a person's personality, is there anything you
can think of now which would change your mind or change the viewpoint that
you held previously that he wasn't violent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I still can recall no incident that I saw, nothing or thought
at the time, with this small exception of the one reference to Mrs. Rainey that&mdash;and
that was a conjecture in reference to myself. Nothing that violent or indeed
that insane.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was it your opinion that Mrs. Oswald was shaken by the
assassination and by the fact that her husband was charged with it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was certainly shaken on the afternoon when the policemen
were out there, when he was at that time just charged with the shooting of
Tippit. I never saw her after he was charged with the shooting of the President.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. One other question: I think you said when Marguerite
Oswald, Lee Oswald's mother, came to your house, and the Life people later appeared,
you spoke of that, did you say that both of them, both Marina and
Marguerite, seemed to be interested in making some kind of a deal with Life
in order to get money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Or were you speaking only of Marguerite Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was speaking only of Marguerite Oswald. I could add here
that Marina appeared to me to want to be courteous and polite toward her
mother-in-law, and wished to go along with whatever wishes Marguerite had
on the subject.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Has anyone tried to make any kind of a business transaction
for your statement or story?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At that time or since?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Since.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. The Commission has a copy of an article that was written
for Look which was not published and will not be.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Has that been testified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will not be what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Published. It is now my property and I don't plan to, I have no
plans presently, at least.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Just for the record, have you entered into any kind of business
transaction by which you would be paid for a story about this assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will not be paid for any story I write, and I am certain now
I don't want to write any such story. I have, however, worked with Miss
Jessamyn West, who is an author for an article which will appear in Time and
Red Book magazine, or I expect it will. She is writing that, she talked to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She approached you on that article?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No one approached me in that article. Was already decided before
I was asked. But that <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who decided it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had implied that I would be willing to do this, but not to
anyone I thought was making an offer. This is aside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was an offer to help the subject of the interview being
interviewed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All I really should say in clarification here is that there was
bad communication between Red Book, Miss West and myself, and she was
under the impression that I had agreed to do this before she had in fact been
contacted, but then the fact of Red Book and Miss West thinking that this was
something I had agreed to I then did agree to do it.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Have you been paid or promised any monetary consideration for any article
that you might write or you might assist someone else in writing about your
experiences connected with the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The complete answer to that would be that I received a $300
advance from Look magazine for helping in the writing of that article which will
not appear, and that I have been told I will receive $500 from Red Book magazine
for helping Miss West in writing that, and if you want, I will tell you what I
think about what I want to do with this money but perhaps that is not pertinent.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. If you want to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I plan to give it away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean give it to charity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To charity.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is all I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have referred to a Look magazine article in the preparation
of which you have assisted. I have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 460 a
document which I received from Mr. George Harris, after you had authorized
me to call him and ask for it.</p>

<p>Would you glance through that and verify that that is the article in the final
form?</p>

<p>You have examined Commission Exhibit 460. Is that the Look article to
which you have made reference in your testimony here this afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that article, however, is not one to be published?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you look over that article in this final form and approve it
as to text and statements made in it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; although I don't think the final draft had been done or
final approval given before it was decided that it would not be used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But as this exhibit stands, Commission Exhibit No. 460, the text
and statements that are made in there had your approval?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they are, of course, not all of my words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of course, not. The article was written by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. By George Harris, who is a senior editor on Look magazine, and
he wrote it from typed copy he had directly as he had taken it from my telling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So it is, to use somewhat of a vernacular, it is ghost written?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is ghost written but most of it is my words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence, as Commission Exhibit No. 460, the document
we have just identified.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. It will be received in evidence.</p>

<p>(The document referred to, heretofore identified as Commission Exhibit No.
460, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have an interest in the Russian language as has appeared
from your testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, are you now or have you ever been a member of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not now and have never been a member of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you now or have you ever had any leanings which we might
call Communist Party leanings.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; on the contrary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you now or have you ever been a member of any groups
which you consciously recognize as being, let us say, Communist front groups?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I have not and I would be quite certain I had not been
unconsciously a member of any such groups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from your response that you have an aversion to
communism?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would be at pains and have been at pains during your adult
life, at least, to avoid any association with or any advancement of communism
as we know and abhor it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>If I may say here, I am offended by the portion of the Communist doctrine
that thinks violence is necessary to achieve its aims. I am likewise offended
by the doctrine that any means to what is considered a good end is legitimate.</p>

<p>I, on the contrary, feel that there is no justification at any time for deception,
and the Communists, as I have observed their activity, have no reluctance to
deceive, and this offends me seriously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In that thinking, violence also impels you against the Communist
faith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It certainly does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or political doctrine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; their espousal of violence repels me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have an interest in the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the members of the Commission, all of them are interested
in how you came to have your interest in the Russian language, and they would
like to have you indicate when it first arose and under what circumstances and
what impelled you to have an interest in the Russian language; start from
the very beginning of your life in that connection&mdash;that episode in your life?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. To be really the very beginning I will start and say
I have been interested in other languages before being interested in Russian. I
studied French in high school, German in college, and got a tutor to study
Yiddish when I was working with a group that spoke that language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the Golden Age group of the <span class="locked">Young&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Men and Young <span class="locked">Women&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hebrew Association in Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that time you were employed by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By that organization. And were you doing work in connection
with this plan of Antioch College?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that was after I had completed my work at Antioch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I do believe I did get some credit for that year at Antioch
although I had completed my academic work, I was still getting some credit
for my job credit, that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, proceed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And then I was working with a group of young Quakers, had
been indeed for sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please fix a little more definite time, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I began my interest in young Quakers in 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1947?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As quite a young girl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When my interest also began in the Quaker church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were then what, you were 19 years old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was going on 15, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Going on 15?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were going to high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where were you living then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was living in Columbus, Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you became interested in the Quaker faith then or at least
in the Quaker activity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were you a member of the Friends Society, young people's
society in Columbus at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I attended the meeting which is the Quaker church in Columbus.
They didn't have enough young people to have a society in that particular
meeting. But then in college I became active in the national young Friends
group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the official name of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The name at that time was the Young Friends Committee of
North America. It included Canada young Friends. And in this connection I
was, I served, as Chairman or Conference Coordinator for a conference of
young friends that was held in 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At Quaker Haven, Ind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you attend that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did. It was at this conference, toward the latter part, part of
really arising out of a discussion of the need for communication and more of
it between the United States and the Soviet Union by no means the bulk of
the business of this conference, but a small committee of interested people,
was working on this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are these interested young people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. These are all young Friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were then of what age, 1955. 23?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. 9 years ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 22, going on 23, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 22 going on 23. Was this in the summer time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Vacation period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. By the way, Mrs. Paine, you had been to England, had you
not, in some activity of the Friends Society back in 1952?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was what meeting did you attend, and as a delegate of what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was selected as a delegate of the Lake Erie Association which
is the larger group to which my meeting in Columbus belonged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your Quaker meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My Quaker meeting. To go as a delegate to the Friends world
conference held at Oxford, England, in the summer of 1952. I also attended
a young Friends conference held in Reading, England, just before the larger
conference. Shall I return now to the conference at Quaker Haven in 1955?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt a calling in Friends terminology at that conference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. An impulse, a desire, is that what you mean, a pulling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. More than that, that God asked of me that I study language,
and I can't say that it was specifically said what language. This was at the
time that plans first began for encouraging an exchange of young people between
the Soviet Union and the United States, and I became active with the committee
planning that, and from that planning there was an exchange, three Soviet
young people came to this country and four young Quakers went to the Soviet
Union, and I was very much impressed with the dearth of people in this country
who could speak Russian. Here was a need for communication with people
we had to live with, although we disagreed with them, certainly disagreed with
the government, and the first elements of communication, the language, was not
available among most young people, and even among older people in the country.
My letter of June 18, 1959, marked Commission Exhibit No. 459-1 contains a
statement of my motivation to study Russian. So it was this really that started
me upon a course of study in Russian. Then once started, I was more propelled
by my interest in the language itself. Shall I describe what training I have had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, please. I want to cover something else before that. I offer
Commission Exhibit No. 459-1 in evidence.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It is received.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a movement also in this connection which you are now
describing of a pen pal communication between young people here in America and
young people in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have anything to do with that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was a subcommittee of this Young Friends Committee
of North America which was called East-West Contact Committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you the leader of that committee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was not. But I was chairman of a committee of that committee,
which was called Correspondence, and I helped make contact between young
people in this country who wished to write to someone in the Soviet Union,
and an organization of young people in Moscow which found pen pals for these
young Americans.</p>

<p>We particularly wanted to go through an official organization so as to be
certain we were not endangering or putting suspicion upon anyone, any young
person in the Soviet Union to whom we were writing. We felt if they picked
their own people that would lessen the suspicion of the Soviet person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you active in that group?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was chairman of that for sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you take part in the pen pal correspondence yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recall now the names of the Russian young people
or Russian young person with whom you communicate, or sought communication?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall I wrote a few letters to a person named Ella, I have
forgotten her last name, and I don't believe I have the correspondence still.
If I did, I don't any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you once had it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If I once had it, I don't have it now in my possession, and then
that stopped because she stopped writing. I wrote and got another correspondent
whose name is Nina Aparina, with whom I corresponded up to last spring,
I would say, and I haven't&mdash;yes; and I haven't heard anything from her for
about a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the nature of the correspondence, particularly with
respect to subject matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In this letter period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We discussed our mutual interest in language. She was a teacher
of the English language. She married an engineer during the time of our
correspondence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Russian citizen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. We exchanged a magnetic tape recording one time. I sent
her one and she sent one with music and readings, hers were music and readings
in Russian, and mine was similar in English as part of language study aid.</p>

<p>My last communication said she was expecting a baby last June but I haven't
heard anything from her since that communication, as I say, probably a year ago
that came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now all of your activity, this activity, of correspondence between
you and any citizen in Russia, was part of it, originated in the Young Friends
group, an activity to supply here a meeting with, communication by, Americans
with citizens in Russia, and then latterly in your communication with the
lady you have last mentioned, a mutual exchange between the two of you here
to improve her English and you to improve your Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. The committee was formed much the same time
that our State Department made arrangements with the Soviets for cultural
exchange, and I think our purposes were similar but, of course, outside the
government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now the three Russian students who came over here, did you
have any contact with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I met them once at an open meeting in North Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were a number of other people present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the only contact you had with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Except that I read a book that was written by one of these
students nearly a year after he had gone back to the Soviet Union which I
found most disillusioning, I must say, in which it was pure propaganda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He sought to report what his experiences here were in America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He sought to report on this trip that he had taken, that we had
worked to achieve.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you regard him as fair or accurate, that is, what you read?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. What I read of the book he wrote was extremely inaccurate and
unfair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it misrepresent America as you knew it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Misrepresented America, certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Shall I go on now to what I have studied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Have you had any formal education in the study of the
Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have. I attended a concentrated summer course at the
University of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1957 where, during the course of
6 weeks, we completed a first year college Russian text.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What year did you say that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe that was 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And then I had difficulty keeping that up, keeping Russian up
over the next year, but the following year I was no longer teaching and took a
course at Berlitz School of Languages in Philadelphia in Russian, and improved
my ability to converse, and it helped me to recall what I had gone through
rather too fast in this accelerated course.</p>

<p>I then applied for the summer course at the Middlebury College summer
language school in Middlebury, Vt., in the summer of 1959 and attended that
7-week course. At Middlebury they required that you speak nothing but the
language you are studying the entire time, both in class and out. This was
very valuable though very difficult.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was your instructor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I took three courses. Natalie Yershov.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were relating, Mrs. Paine, you recalled one of your instructors
at Middlebury?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the name of any other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Offhand I can't recall. I recall certainly the director of the
school but he was not an instructor of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a roommate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your roommate's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Her name was Helen Mamikonian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you still have contact with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It has been a long time since I have written but we have exchanged
Christmas cards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Christmas cards and an occasional letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She lives and works in Boston where she is a teacher of Russian
language at Simmons College, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she at one time live in New York City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; her home is New York. She spent her high school years
there after having immigrated from France, and I believe her mother still
lives there, is a tutor for the Berlitz School in Russian in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her mother is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now we have your study at Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, and
your study at the Berlitz School in Philadelphia, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your study at Middlebury College. What additional formal
or at least let us say semiformal instruction or education have you had in
the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I then moved to the Dallas area to the place where I presently
live in Irving, and then I would guess it was early in 1960 I took up some
study again at the Berlitz School in Dallas, completed a course which I had
paid for in Philadelphia, and then went on after that with private lessons with
Mrs. Gravitis, who has already been mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Mrs. Gravitis also an instructor in the Berlitz School in
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I met her because she was an instructor for a short time there
and I think is yet on call to them as an instructor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that cover your formal education in the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, are you a teacher of Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have one student whom I teach beginning Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a connection with an established institution?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It began in connection with an established institution during
the summer of 1963, at the Saint Marks School of Texas in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were the teacher of Russian in the Saint Marks School
during that quarter or summer term?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Summer term.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And arising out of that has been your engagement as a tutor,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is your student?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My student's name is Bill H-U-T-K-I-N-S.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he, what is he, a young man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am sorry, it is H-O-O-T-K-I-N-S.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old is he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He turned 15 in the summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he a native American so far as you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As far as I know, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your&mdash;has it been also your desired objective on your part
to teach Russian as a regular instructor or teacher in the public or private
schools?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I would like to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is still your hope and desire?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It interests me very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it has been for sometime an objective of yours, has it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will ask you a couple of general questions. First, I will probably
repeat this when I examine you in your deposition also, Mrs. Paine, but I
desire to have it on this record before the Commission, is there anything that
has come to your mind that you would like to relate to the Commission which
you think might be helpful to it in its deliberations in consideration of the
serious problems and events into which they are inquiring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There are a few small items I hope we will get into tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please state them as to subject matter, at least.
Would they take very long for you to state?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will make an attempt to be brief here. I recall that Lee once
used my typewriter to type something else beside this note, is that what you
want?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; would you turn and direct your remarks to the Chairman,
to Senator Cooper, so we can all hear you and you might speak up a little bit,
your voice has been dropping.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am tired.</p>

<p>I recall that Lee once asked to borrow my typewriter and used it to type
something I judged was a letter at sometime prior to this day November 9,
when he typed a letter which we have a rough draft. This is probably no use
to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what I call the Mexico letter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is what you call it, all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Give the exhibit.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is Exhibit No. 103.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I want to know whether you want to inquire of me my account
of Secret Service agents having come and asked me, having come out to the house
after the assassination to ask me if I had ever seen a particular note which
they had. And I have later assumed that this is what has been referred to
in the press as the note written by Oswald at the time of the attempt on
Walker and if you want I will make it clear all I know in relation to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I recall that incident and I wish you would, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And then the other thing is simply to invite the members of the
Commission, but if it is a deposition I can't do that then, to feel free to ask
me any questions that are not settled in their mind or clear regarding the
separation which existed between myself and my husband, if that is troublesome
in any way or if there is anything in <span class="locked">which&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, if that doesn't embarrass you, members of the Commission
have voiced to me some interest in that, that is an interest only to the
extent they are seeking to resolve in their mind who Ruth Paine is and if I may
use the vernacular, what makes her tick, so would you relate that now on the
Commission record, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. I might say that I think it is important and relevant
here because if I had not been separated from my husband I would have not as I
think I have already testified, made an invitation to anyone to join the family
circle, especially in such a small house.</p>

<p>Really, I might ask if you have questions it might be easier for me to answer
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Perhaps we can bring it along in this fashion. What was the
cause of the separation between your husband and yourself, in your view?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In my view, of course, yes. He expressed himself as not really
interested in remaining married to me. We never quarreled. We never indeed
have had any serious difference of opinion except I want to live with him and
he is not that interested in being with me, would be our single difference of
opinion.</p>

<p>And in the spring of 1962 I felt that something more definite should be done,
and asked Michael why he continued to live with me if he felt that way about
it, and he said that it was easier and cost less, and I said that wasn't a good
enough reason for a marriage, and asked him to be out of the house in the fall
when I returned from summer vacation that year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 1962, yes. I would say our marriage is marked both by mutual
honesty, that is exceptional, and by a lack of overt or interior strife except that
it hasn't quite come together as a mutual partnership.</p>

<p>My mother recently said to me that "If you would just look only at what
Michael does there is nothing wrong with your marriage at all. It is just what
he says", and I concur with her opinion on that, that he is so scrupulously honest
with his own feelings that, and really too hard on himself in a sense, that he
states verbally this is not feeling that he loves me or loves me enough, but in fact
his actions toward me are totally acceptable to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he gracious and kind and attentive to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has he always been?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Insufficiently attentive, I would say, but he is always kind and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you had any financial differences of opinion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He even during this period of time when you were separated,
he voluntarily supported the household and you lived in a manner and style that
suited you or to which you had become accustomed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had no arguments about matters of that nature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband has returned to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He is living there now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long has that been?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He has been staying there since the night of November 22. He
didn't move his belongings in until the middle of the following week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say this is a reconciliation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You cannot.</p>

<p>Do you wish to say any more in the statement of yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not unless you have questions. I think it is an accurate statement
of the marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>What brought this forth was my asking you if you had anything you would
like to bring before the Commission.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are there any others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can think of nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your present recollection are the statements and
the testimony you gave, you have given so far, before the Commission consistent
with statements you have given to the FBI, to Secret Service, to magazine reporters,
editors, to anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The statements I have given here are fully consistent with anything
I have said before except that the statement here has been much fuller
than any single previous statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have testified to matters and things before the Commission
about which, which you did not relate or even had occasion to relate in
your mind, at least, to FBI agents, to Secret Service agents and to the others
that you have identified in general terms?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, you and I had the opportunity, you afforded me the
privilege of speaking with you before your testimony commenced, before the
Commission. And also I think the first day of your testimony you were gracious
enough to return here to the Commission room and we spent several hours
talking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As a matter of fact, we left around 12:30, a quarter of one in
the morning, did we not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, that is right, we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, recalling back to those periods of conferences with me, do
you have any feeling or notion whatsoever that any of your testimony before the
Commission was in any degree whatsoever, inconsistent with anything you
related to me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no; I don't think so, not in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not in any way. Do you have any feeling whatsoever that
during the course of my conferences with you, outside this Commission, that I
influenced or sought to shape your testimony in any respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. Clearly I felt no influence from you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All of the statements that you related to me were free and
voluntary on your part, and not given under any coercion, light or heavy, as the
case might be, on my part.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, there are some additional matters we wish to
examine the witness about and Representative Ford has given me a rather long
list of questions he asked me to cover. He regretted that was necessary because
of his enforced absence, and Mrs. Paine has agreed that she would be available
in the morning, and I may examine her by way of deposition before a reporter
under oath, and with that understanding of the Commission, of you, Mr. Chairman,
I would at this moment as far as the staff is concerned, close the formal
testimony of Mrs. Paine before the Commission, with advice to you, sir, that
tomorrow morning I will cover additional matters by way of deposition.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. As I understand the matters you will go into by deposition
will not be any new evidence in the sense of substance but more <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I can tell you what they are, it will be her background, some of
which she has now given in regard to her study of the Russian language.</p>

<p>More formal proof of her calendar, and her address book. Also her general
background which I have already mentioned. Some correspondence between
herself and her mother, and the items that Mrs. Paine has now mentioned she
would like to relate herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. One of which we took care of already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One of which we took care of. We will cover those and I was
going to ask her questions tomorrow, some of which we have already covered of
Lee Harvey Oswald's personality and habits and actions.</p>

<p>I am going to ask here about Mrs. Shirley Martin, who has appeared on the
scene since the assassination, and appears to be a self-appointed investigator,
and to the extent that there has been any contact between Mrs. Paine and Mrs.
Shirley Martin, and then inquire, I may not even do this because we have
covered a very great deal of the conversations and discussions between Marina
and Mrs. Paine on various possible subjects, and I can see from my list we have
covered many of them already.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Let it be ordered that evidence will be taken this way, with
this reservation, of course, if the Commission determines after studying the
deposition that it would be necessary for her to be called again, you would be
willing to come again before the Commission to testify.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would certainly be willing if there is any need for my coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In addition to this, Mr. Chairman, as I think already appears of
record, I will come to Mrs. Paine's home in Irving, Tex., sometime on Monday
or Monday evening or if she finds it more convenient, on Tuesday of next week to
inquire of her with a court reporter present relative to the curtain rod package,
and I also will make a tour of her home and as we move about her home the
reporter will record the conversation between us, questions and answers.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Are there any further questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. All right, then we will stand in recess subject to the call of
the Chairman of the Commission.</p>

<p>(Translations of letters introduced in evidence in the course of Mrs. Paine's
testimony are reproduced in the exhibit volumes.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. 6814 Woodward, Dallas 27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And how old a man are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. 45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Two children. One grandson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation, Mr. Brennan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Steamfitter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And for whom are you employed, or by whom are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Wallace and Beard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that a construction company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And let me ask you this: How long have you been a steamfitter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Since 1943, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you work for one employer, or do you go from job to job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I go from job to job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that at your direction or at the direction of any union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Local 100 in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, where were you on the early part of the afternoon
of November 22, 1963, say around noon or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I left a position behind the Book Store, which is a leased
part of Katy Yards, which we have fabrication for pipe for the Republic Bank
Building. At 12 o'clock I went to the cafeteria on the corner of Main and
Record. I believe that is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be at Main and Record Streets in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And did you have your lunch there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then after lunch, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I finished lunch and I glanced at a clock&mdash;I don't know exactly
where the clock is located&mdash;and noticed it was 12:18. So I thought I still had
a few minutes, that I might see the parade and the President.</p>

<p>I walked to the corner of Houston and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What route did you take to get to Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I went west on Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went west on Main from Record Street <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Houston</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. And on the east side of Houston, I walked to Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Crossed the street to the southwest corner of Houston and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any estimate about how long it took you to get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. A possibility I would say more or less 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what did you do when you got to the southwest corner
of Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I stayed around a couple of minutes. There was a man having
an epileptic fit, a possibility of 20 yards east&mdash;south of this corner. And they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
were being attended by some civilians and officers, and I believe an ambulance
picked him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. And I walked over to this retainer wall of this little park
pool and jumped up on the top ledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You jumped up on the retaining wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I hand you what has been marked as Exhibit 477.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 477 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I ask you to state if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you please tell the Commission what this is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is the Book Store at the corner of Houston and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the Book Store, you mean the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, do you know <span class="locked">what&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is the retainer wall which I perched on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. This is the retaining wall on which you perched. I
believe that this is actually you sitting on this retaining wall in a picture that
we took in Dallas pursuant to your showing us where you were November 22;
we took that picture on this past Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which would be the 20th of March. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. I hand you now what the reporter has marked as
Commission Exhibit 478.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 478 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I ask you to state, if you know, what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. That is the retaining wall and myself sitting on it at
Houston and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You remember that the photographer was standing on the front
steps of the Texas School Book Depository when that picture was taken on the
20th of March?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And the camera is pointed in what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. South.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Are those the positions where you were sitting on
November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At about <span class="locked">12&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. From about 12:22 or 12:24 until the time of the assassination.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In both pictures, that is a <span class="locked">true&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. True location.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. True location of where you were sitting November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, I am going to hand you a negative, which has been
marked as Commission Exhibit 479.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 479 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This appears to be a negative from a moving picture film. And I
will hand you a magnifying glass&mdash;the negative has been enlarged. This negative
appears to be a picture of the Presidential motorcade on the afternoon of
November 22d. I ask you to state if you can find yourself in the crowd in the
background in that picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. I am sitting at the same position as I was in the picture
taken Friday, with the exception, I believe, my hand is resting on the wall, and
Friday my hand, I believe, was resting on my leg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, your legs in this picture, Exhibit 479, I notice, are not
dangling on the front side there, is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were you wearing on November 22d? What clothes were
you wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Gray khaki work clothes, with a dark gray hard helmet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your head here appears to be the highest in the group, a little
bit left of center in the upper part of the picture, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does this scene depict the scene as you recollect it on that day,
November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. It does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, could you please tell the Commission what happened
from the time you sat on that retaining wall, what you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I was more or less observing the crowd and the people
in different building windows, including the fire escape across from the Texas
Book Store on the east side of the Texas Book Store, and also the Texas Book
Store Building windows. I observed quite a few people in different windows.
In particular, I saw this one man on the sixth floor which left the window to my
knowledge a couple of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you say the window on the sixth floor. What building are
you referring to there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is the Texas Book Store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to ask you to circle on Exhibit 477 the particular
window that you said you saw a man leave and come back a couple of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I am confused here, the way this shows. But I believe
this is the sixth floor, the way those windows are built there right at the present.
I am confused whether this is the same window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean because some windows are open below it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No. The way the building is built, it seems like this is more
or less a long window with a divider in the middle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Here is a marking pencil. Will you just mark the window that you
believe you saw the man.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>And do you want to put a letter "A", if you would, by that.</p>

<p>All right, now you have marked on Commission Exhibit 477 a circle with the
letter "A" to show the window that you saw a man in, I believe you said, at
least two times come back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any other people in any other windows that you can
recollect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Not on that floor.</p>

<p>There was no other person on that floor that ever came to the window that I
noticed.</p>

<p>There were people on the next floor down, which is the fifth floor, colored
guys. In particular, I only remember two that I identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to mark the window with the circle that you believe
you saw some Negro people on the fifth floor. Could you do that with this
marking pencil on Exhibit 477, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. The two that I identified, I believe, was in this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You want to put a "B" on that one?</p>

<p>Now, after you saw the man&mdash;well, just tell what else you saw during that
afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, as the parade came by, I watched it from a distance of
Elm and Main Street, as it came on to Houston and turned the corner at Houston
and Elm, going down the incline towards the railroad underpass. And after the
President had passed my position, I really couldn't say how many feet or how
far, a short distance I would say, I heard this crack that I positively thought
was a backfire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You thought it was backfire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Of a motorcycle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you observe or hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, then something, just right after this explosion, made me
think that it was a firecracker being thrown from the Texas Book Store. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
I glanced up. And this man that I saw previous was aiming for his last shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This man you saw previous? Which man are you talking about
now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. The man in the sixth story window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you describe just exactly what you saw when you saw him
this last time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, as it appeared to me he was standing up and resting
against the left window sill, with gun shouldered to his right shoulder, holding
the gun with his left hand and taking positive aim and fired his last shot. As I
calculate a couple of seconds. He drew the gun back from the window as
though he was drawing it back to his side and maybe paused for another second
as though to assure hisself that he hit his mark, and then he disappeared.</p>

<p>And, at the same moment, I was diving off of that firewall and to the right
for bullet protection of this stone wall that is a little higher on the Houston side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let me ask you. What kind of a gun did you see in that
window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I am not an expert on guns. It was, as I could observe, some
type of a high-powered rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you tell whether or not it had any kind of a scope on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I did not observe a scope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you tell whether or not it had one? Do you know whether
it did or not, or could you observe that it definitely did or definitely did not, or
don't you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I do not know if it had a scope or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe you said you thought the man was standing. What do
you believe was the position of the people on the fifth floor that you saw&mdash;standing
or sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I thought they were standing with their elbows on the window
sill leaning out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At the time you saw this man on the sixth floor, how much of the
man could you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I could see&mdash;at one time he came to the window and
he sat sideways on the window sill. That was previous to President Kennedy
getting there. And I could see practically his whole body, from his hips up.
But at the time that he was firing the gun, a possibility from his belt up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How much of the gun do you believe that you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I calculate 70 to 85 percent of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what direction the gun was pointing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what direction was the gun pointing when you saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. At somewhat 30 degrees downward and west by south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know down what street it was pointing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. Down Elm Street toward the railroad underpasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, up to the time of the shots, did you observe anything else
that you have not told us about here that you can think of right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, not of any importance. I don't remember anything else
<span class="locked">except&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Positively two. I do not recall a second <span class="locked">shot&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By a second shot, you mean a middle shot between the time you
heard the first noise and the last noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; that is right. I don't know what made me think that there
was firecrackers throwed out of the Book Store unless I did hear the second
shot, because I positively thought the first shot was a backfire, and subconsciously
I must have heard a second shot, but I do not recall it. I could not swear to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you describe the man you saw in the window on the sixth
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. To my best description, a man in his early thirties, fair complexion,
slender but neat, neat slender, possibly 5-foot 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what weight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Oh, at&mdash;I calculated, I think, from 160 to 170 pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A white man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what kind of clothes he was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Light colored clothes, more of a khaki color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember the color of his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I believe you said that after the last shot you jumped off
this masonry structure on which you were sitting. Why did you jump off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, it occurred to me that there might be more than one
person, that it was a plot which could mean several people, and I knew beyond
reasonable doubt that there were going to be bullets flying from every direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do after that? Or what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I observed to my thinking that they were directing their search
towards the west side of the building and down Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say "they", who do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Law-enforcement officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the west side of the building, you mean towards the underpass
or railroad tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you saw that, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I knew I had to get to someone quick to tell them where the
man was. So I ran or I walked&mdash;there is a possibility I ran, because I have a
habit of, when something has to be done in a hurry, I run. And there was one
officer standing at the corner of the Texas Book Store on the street. It didn't
seem to me he was going in any direction. He was standing still.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do or what did you say to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I asked him to get me someone in charge, a Secret Service
man or an FBI. That it appeared to me that they were searching in the wrong
direction for the man that did the shooting.</p>

<p>And he was definitely in the building on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>I did not say on the sixth floor. Correction there.</p>

<p>I believe I identified the window as one window from the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Because, at that time, I did not know how many story building
it was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But you did say to the policeman it was a window on
the second floor from the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. <span class="locked">He&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. May I ask there. By the second floor from the top, do you
mean the one directly underneath the top floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Underneath the top floor, excluding the roof, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what happened, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. He said, "Just a minute." And he had to give some orders or
something on the east side of the building on Houston Street. And then he
had taken me to, I believe, Mr. Sorrels, an automobile sitting in front of the
Texas Book Store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what happened there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I related my information and there was a few minutes of discussion,
and Mr. Sorrels had taken me then across the street to the sheriff's
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you describe the man that you saw in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, later that afternoon, or the next day, did you have
occasion to go down to the Dallas Police Station to try to identify any person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That evening, the Secret Service picked me up, Mr. Patterson,
I believe, at 6 o'clock, at my home, and taken me to the Dallas Police Station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Could you tell us what happened there, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. If I might add a part, that I left out a couple of minutes
<span class="locked">ago&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go right ahead, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. As Mr. Sorrels and some more men were discussing this, I
mentioned these two colored guys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Came out of the book store, running down the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the <span class="locked">two&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That I had previously saw on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. And I immediately identified these two boys to the officers and
Mr. Sorrels as being on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have anything else you wish to add now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; that concludes that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They were running out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. They came running down the front steps of the building on the
Elm street side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did they then disappear in the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; they took them in custody, I suppose, and questioned them.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The law enforcement officers stopped them, and you did
what, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No. I believe Mr. Sorrels or the Secret Service man stopped
them.</p>

<p>I am not sure, but I don't believe an officer of the police department stopped
them.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But you were standing on the steps of the Texas School
Book Depository Building talking to whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Mr. Sorrels and another man, and I believe there was an officer
standing there, a police officer.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And these two Negroes came out of the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you did what then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Spoke to Mr. Sorrels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Spoke to Mr. Sorrels, and told him that those were the two
colored boys that was on the fifth floor, or on the next floor underneath the man
that fired the gun.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You positively identified them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I did, at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else now up to the time you got down to the
Dallas Police Station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, nothing except that up until that time, through my entire
life, I could never remember what a colored person looked like if he got out of
my sight. And I always thought that if I had to identify a colored person I
could not. But by coincidence that one time I did recognize those two boys.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did those two Negro men say in your presence that they
had been in the fifth floor window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I don't recall. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else, sir, now up to the time you got down to the
Dallas Police Station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. On Friday evening, you are speaking of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>What happened when you got down to the Dallas Police Station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Mr. Patterson, if I am correct in the Secret Service that picked
me up, directed me to go to the fourth floor, a certain room on that floor.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Warren and Representative Ford withdrew from the
hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I later was introduced to several men&mdash;Captain Fritz in Mr.
Sorrels' office, and several more men. I do not remember their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, do you remember the name of the officer you talked to
in front of the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I don't believe I ever heard it. I do not remember his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you sure of the names of the Secret Service men you talked
to? I believe you mentioned the name Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I do not know the other man's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You believe one of them was Sorrels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe one of them was Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think for the <span class="locked">record&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is at the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I think we should offer and introduce Commission Exhibits 477, 478, and 479.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Chief Justice has asked me to preside in his absence this
morning.</p>

<p>They shall be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 477, 478 and 479, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, Mr. Brennan, I note that you have glasses with you
here today.</p>

<p>Were you wearing glasses at the time of the incident that you related here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No. I only use glasses to see fine print and more especially
the Bible and blueprint.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And have you had your eyes checked within the past 2 or 3
years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. These here were prescriptioned, I believe, a possibility less
than a year before the incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Does that mean you are farsighted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Has there been anything that has happened since the time of
November 22, 1963, that has changed your eyesight in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What has happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. The last of January I got both eyes sandblasted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is January of 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. And I had to be treated by a Doctor Black, I believe,
in the Medical Arts Building, through the company. And I was completely
blind for about 6 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How is your eyesight today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. He says it is not good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But this occurred January of this year, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, taking you down to the Dallas Police Station, I believe
you said you talked to Captain Fritz. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I was just more or less introduced to him in Mr. Sorrels'
room, and they told me they were going to conduct a lineup and wanted me
to view it, which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how many people were in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; I don't. A possibility seven more or less one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Did you see anyone in the lineup you recognized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I told Mr. Sorrels and Captain Fritz at that time that Oswald&mdash;or
the man in the lineup that I identified looking more like a closest
resemblance to the man in the window than anyone in the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were the other people in the lineup, do you remember&mdash;were
they all white, or were there some Negroes in there, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As I understand your testimony, then, you said that you told
him that this particular person looked the most like the man you saw on the
sixth floor of the building there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the meantime, had you seen any pictures of Lee Harvey Oswald
on television or in the newspapers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About when was that, do you believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe I reached home quarter to three or something of
that, 15 minutes either way, and I saw his picture twice on television before
I went down to the police station for the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, is there anything else you told the officers at the time of
the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I told them I could not make a positive identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you told them that, did you ever later tell any officer or
investigating person anything different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did that happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe some days later&mdash;I don't recall exactly&mdash;and I believe
the Secret Service man identified hisself as being Williams, I believe,
from Houston. I won't swear to that&mdash;whether his name was Williams or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. And he could have been an FBI. As far as I remember, it
could have been FBI instead of Secret Service.</p>

<p>But I believe it was a Secret Service man from Houston.</p>

<p>And <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say to you and what did you say to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, he asked me&mdash;he said, "You said you couldn't make a
positive identification."</p>

<p>He said, "Did you do that for security reasons personally, or couldn't you?"</p>

<p>And I told him I could with all honesty, but I did it more or less for security
reasons&mdash;my family and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean by security reasons for your family and
yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe at that time, and I still believe it was a Communist
activity, and I felt like there hadn't been more than one eyewitness, and if it
got to be a known fact that I was an eyewitness, my family or I, either one,
might not be safe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, if you wouldn't have identified him, might he not have been
released by the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Beg pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you would not have identified that man positively, might he not
have been released by the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No. That had a great contributing factor&mdash;greater contributing
factor than my personal reasons was that I already knew they had the man
for murder, and I knew he would not be released.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The murder of whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Of Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, what happened in between to change your mind that you
later decided to come forth and tell them you could identify him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. After Oswald was killed, I was relieved quite a bit that as
far as pressure on myself of somebody not wanting me to identify anybody,
there was no longer that immediate danger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not your having seen Oswald
on television would have affected your identification of him one way or the
other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is something I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, could you tell us now whether you can or cannot
positively identify the man you saw on the sixth floor window as the same man
that you saw in the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I could at that time&mdash;I could, with all sincerity, identify him as
being the same man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the man that you saw in the window firing the rifle the same
man that you had seen earlier in the window, you said at least a couple of times,
first stepping up and then going back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far were you away from that window at the time you
saw him, Mr. Brennan?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, at that time, I calculated 110-foot at an angle. But
closer surveillance I believe it will run close to 122 to 126 feet at an angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe that on Friday we paced the distance between the place
where you were sitting and the front door of the Texas School Book Depository
Building, and it ran <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. 93-foot.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This doesn't have to be now, but I think some time he
ought to step by step on a diagram trace his movements from the restaurant
until he left the scene of the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On that particular diagram, Congressman Ford, which is Exhibit
No. 361, the intersection of Main and Houston, and of Record and Main is not
shown. It would be a little bit to the south.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But he might be able to show the direction from which
he came to get on to the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes; that he can do.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And then his movements from there on until he left the
area. I think it would be very helpful to tie down the precise places he was from
time to time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think he might do that right now.</p>

<p>Mr. Brennan, I place in front of you Exhibit 361, and I call to your attention
that the top appears to be south rather than north, and the arrow north is
pointed towards the bottom. And you will notice at the top here, running in what
would be an east-west direction, is Elm Street. And you can see running in a
north-south direction Houston Street, with the Texas School Book Depository
Building noted here in black.</p>

<p>Do you see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. It should be here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I will turn the map around to show you north and south; we
can keep it upside down for the moment.</p>

<p>This is Elm Street. To the north is Pacific. Main would be down here off the
bottom of the map. And here is Record Street right here. And I believe
you said you were at lunch at Record and Main, and then you walked to the
south.</p>

<p>I wonder if you might take this pen and kind of, off the street markings, you
might start maybe down here at the bottom as to where you had your lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. This is Main here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Main would be running there, yes.</p>

<p>If you would, put a "D" at that point.</p>

<p>Now, if you would kind of on a line trace your course that you took that day.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I didn't go to the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't go to the corner of Elm and Houston. That would be
the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I noticed this man having a fit. And I came across at this
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, would you put the letter "E" where you ended up sitting.
This is on Exhibit No. 361.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. "E"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe that would be just about where the retainer wall is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>So you have put on Exhibit 361 the letter "E" where you were sitting facing
the School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think that it might be helpful to trace it where he
went subsequent to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the time of the shooting, would you put a line from your point
at point "E" to where you went to talk to the police officers and the Secret Service
officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. The retaining wall come around here and straight across here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you put an "F" where you talked to him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. The car was sitting here. That is where I talked to him.
This is where I contacted the officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You contacted the officer at "F".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you went over to a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you put your direction to the car and put a "G" on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I walked down the street hereaways with this officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, the point from "F" where you walked down the street,
that would be walking north on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I don't know; however, we walked down this way, but I do
remember going in that direction with the officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went to the north on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. And then back <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, just put a mark in there, and cut it back, if you could, just
to show the route of you going north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I don't know exactly however.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Will you put a mark to "G" at the end? And I believe you said that the car
that you talked to the Secret Service agent in was at point "G" approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, are these accurate or approximate locations, Mr. Brennan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, don't you have photographs of me talking to the Secret
Service men right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. You should have. It was on television before I got home&mdash;my
wife saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At this time we do not have them.</p>

<p>Do you remember what station they were on television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No. But they had it. And I called I believe Mr. Lish who
requested that he cut those films or get them cut of the FBI. I believe you
might know about them. Somebody cut those films, because a number of times
later the same films were shown, and that part was cut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who would Mr. Lish be with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. The FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>We thank you very much for that information.</p>

<p>Is there anything else that you did at point "G" or anywhere else after the
time of the assassination before you went to the Sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I walked up the steps and stood on the outside of the doorway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of what building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Of the Texas Book Store, while the officers or the men that
I was with gave some more orders. And then Mr. Sorrels taken me across to
the Sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You did not go inside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice any people coming out of the front stairs of the
building after these two Negroes came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I recall people going in and out, but a different picture
I cannot remember.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where were you standing when you identified the two
Negroes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. On the edge of the street, outer side of the sidewalk, when
the two colored boys came out of the building and came down the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that at point "G"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps on Exhibit No. 478 you can trace your route at least along
Houston Street to the time&mdash;to the place where you were sitting. You recognize
the intersection of Main and Houston there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Could you start there and kind of trace&mdash;well, I don't know if you can see
all of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do the best you can, you can trace along here.</p>

<p>Here would be the intersection of Main and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I came down that side. Now, this street was open at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By this street you mean Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. I don't recall any parked cars there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you make that line a little darker, sir, that you have put on.</p>

<p>All right. Now, at that first point, this would <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe I walked a little south there, just observing them
picking the man up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You have marked a line on Exhibit No. 478 heading a little bit south on
the west side of Houston street, commencing at the southwest corner of the
intersection, which is where you say you walked to watch the man with the
epileptic fit, is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I didn't go up&mdash;he was almost center way of the block
here. I didn't go up that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>And will you put the letter "H" there, if you would?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Where I was standing watching the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where you were standing watching the man; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then where did you go from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, you have taken a line which would be running along the south side
of Elm Street there towards the point where you are sitting, and that is in
the picture Exhibit 478. And that was the route that you took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Put the letter "I", if you would, there, please.</p>

<p>Now, on Exhibit No. 477, I wonder if you would perchance show us after the
assassination, or the shooting&mdash;you said you first went over to another side
of the wall.</p>

<p>Would it be to the east or to the west there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. To the east. This right here is solid concrete.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is this where you went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>On Exhibit 477, could you put the letter "J" where you went right after
the shooting?</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Now, I believe you said you later stood up and eventually walked across the
street to get a police officer. On Exhibit 477, could you put a letter "K" where
you believe you went to talk to this police officer, where he was.</p>

<p>It looks like there is a car there now.</p>

<p>So you went from point "J" to point "K", and point "K", on Exhibit 477,
would correspond with "F" on Exhibit 361, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, I wonder if you could perchance show on Exhibit 477 the point that
corresponds with point "G" on Exhibit 361, which is where you said you went
to the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. This car here&mdash;letter what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. "L".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is this car here, sitting approximately <span class="locked">where&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I note that this car that you have marked the "L" is not actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
on the extreme north part of Elm, but really appears to be on that part which
is going down to the Freeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Oh, is that right?</p>

<p>Yes; you are correct there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, is this accurate, or was it one that you saw parked right
in front of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right next to the curb in front of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be behind&mdash;you might put the letter "M" to show the
car which it is behind now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have put the letter "M" on Exhibit 477 to show the car
behind the one which the Secret Service car was parked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At this time I believe Exhibits 477, 478 and 479 should be reoffered
to show all of the markings that the witness has made on these exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They shall be admitted as remarked.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to, previously marked for identification as Commission's
Exhibit Nos. 477, 478, and 479 were readmitted into evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And also Exhibit 361 should be reoffered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is 361?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It is the large chart which also has been marked on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It shall be admitted again, remarked.</p>

<p>(The chart referred to, previously marked as Commission's Exhibit No. 361
for identification, was readmitted into evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, in this sixth floor window, where you saw the gun
fired, did you see any objects of any kind in the window, or near the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. Through the window, which I referred to as back in
the book store building, I could see stacks of boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I hand you what has been marked as Exhibit 480, which
appears to be a picture of the Texas School Book Depository Building, which
was taken shortly after this time.</p>

<p>I believe on the fifth floor you can see on two of the open windows there some
people looking out, and Exhibit 481 is a picture of the east windows on the south
side of the fifth and sixth floors, and Exhibit 482 is an enlargement of 481.</p>

<p>First of all, on Exhibits 481 and 482, do you recognize any of these two
persons in the fifth floor window as people you saw there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; I do not recognize them.</p>

<p>As positive identification I cannot recognize them.</p>

<p>Now, I see where there is a possibility I did make a mistake. I believe these
two colored boys was in this window, and I believe I showed on that other
exhibit that they were in this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I am going to hand you <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. The only thing I said is that they were one window over
below the man that fired the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I hand you Commission Exhibit 477, where you marked a
"B" at the point there you first said you saw the Negro men. Is this the one
you say now you might have been mistaken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; I believe I was mistaken. I believe the two men that
I identified was in this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to the window to the east of where you have
now marked "B"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That I am not positive of. I just remember that they were
over one window from below him, which at that time I might have thought
this was one window over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Let me ask you this. On Exhibit 481, does the condition
of the opening of the windows in the fifth floor appear to be that which you
saw on the afternoon of November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. These do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to the fifth-floor windows now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. But I don't recall this window at the time of the shooting
being that low.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, by this window you are pointing to the window on the sixth
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Exhibit 481. I wonder if you would mark that with the
letter "A"&mdash;if you would circle that window. And could you put an "A" on
that, if you would.</p>

<p>Now, window A, on Exhibit 481, when you saw it, how high do you believe
it was open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe that at the time he was firing, it was open just like
this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Just like the windows on the fifth floor immediately below?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I note in window "A" there appear to be some boxes in the
window. To the best of your recollection, what is the fact as to whether or not
those boxes as shown in this exhibit appear to be similar to the ones you saw
on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; I could see more boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the window or behind the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Behind the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am talking in the window itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No, no. That is&mdash;I don't remember a box in the window, these
boxes I remember are stacked up behind the window, and they were zigzagged,
kind of step down, and there was a space it looked like back of here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you are pointing to a space which would be on the east side,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say you don't <span class="locked">remember&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I can see those boxes there now. I don't know whether
you can see them or not. It seems like I can see the boxes in that picture.
Am I right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I don't know, sir. I can't see them on Exhibit 471. That could
be the dirty window here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Here they are here. Those boxes there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, here is Exhibit 482.</p>

<p>First of all, I see a box on Exhibit 482, right in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; I don't recall that box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you recall that it definitely was not there, or just you don't
recall whether it was or was not there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I do not recall that being there. So, therefore, I could not
say it definitely wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You cannot say whether it was or was not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Exhibit 482, do you want to point an arrow to where you
believe you can see boxes back there. Or where you saw boxes.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Let the record show that Exhibits 480, 481, and 482 were taken by, I believe
it is, Underwood or&mdash;just a second. Thomas C. Dillard, Chief Photographer
of the Dallas Morning News, who was riding in the car with Robert H. Jackson,
who has already testified before the Commission, and the deposition of Mr.
Dillard will be taken by Mr. Ball and me in Dallas in the first part of April.</p>

<p>And that Exhibits 480, 481, and 482 were taken shortly after the firing of the
third shot. I think that this should appear in the record.</p>

<p>I think it should also appear in the record that Exhibit 479 is one of the
frames from the Abraham Zapruder movie film.</p>

<p>Mr. Brennan, from the time you first saw the Presidential motorcade turning
north on Houston from Main, did you observe the window from which you say
you saw the last shot fired at any time prior to the time you saw the rifle in the
window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, what I am saying is this. You saw the motorcade turn?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; not after I saw the motorcade, I did not observe a man
or rifle in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you observe the window at all until after you heard that first
sound which was a backfire or firecracker, at least you thought it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you did not observe the window and would not know whether
or not there was any man in the window during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let the record be clear. The first sound you first thought
was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Backfire of a motorcycle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you later said something about a firecracker.</p>

<p>Did that have reference to the first shot, or something in between the first
and last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I positively thought that the first shot was a backfire of a
motorcycle. And then something made me think that someone was throwing
firecrackers from the Texas Book Store, and a possibility it was the second shot.
But I glanced up or looked up and I saw this man taking aim for his last shot.
The first shot and last shot is my only positive recollection of two shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you see the rifle explode? Did you see the flash of what
was either the second or the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Could you see that he had discharged the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No. For some reason I did not get an echo at any time.
The first shot was positive and clear and the last shot was positive and clear,
with no echo on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>But you saw him aim?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you see the rifle discharge, did you see the recoil or the
flash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But you heard the last shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. The report; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you see who or what he was aiming at? You testified as
to the declination of the rifle, the angle of the rifle. But could you see what
he was firing at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Subconsciously I knew what he was firing at. But immediately
I looked towards where President Kennedy's car should be, and there was
something obstructing my view. I could not see the President or his car at
that time.</p>

<p>And I still don't know what was obstructing my view, because I was high
enough that I should have been able to see it. I could not see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, on one of your interviews with the FBI, they record
a statement that you estimated your distance between the point you were seated
and the window from which the shots were fired as approximately 90 yards.</p>

<p>At that time did you make that statement to the FBI&mdash;and this would be on
22 November. To the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. There was a mistake in the FBI recording there. He had
asked me the question of how far the shot was fired from too, and also he had
asked me the question of how far I was from the shot that was fired. I calculated
the distance at the angle his gun was resting that he must have been
firing 80 to 90 yards.</p>

<p>Now, <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean 80 or 90 yards from where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. From Kennedy's position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But could you see Kennedy's position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; I could not. But I could see before and after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In that same interview, you stated that you attended a lineup at
the Dallas Police Department at which you picked Lee Harvey Oswald as the
person most closely resembling the man you observed with the rifle in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
window of the Texas School Book Depository, but you stated you could not
positively identify Oswald as the person you saw fire the rifle.</p>

<p>Now, is this an accurate recording of the statement you made to the FBI on or
about November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; I <span class="locked">believe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, that part of the FBI statement is correct, as to
what you told them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was the fact as to whether you could or could not identify
the person, apart from what you told them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Why did <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No.</p>

<p>What was the fact. Could you or could you not actually identify this person
as the man you saw firing the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believed I could with all fairness and sincerity. As you
asked me the question before, had I saw those pictures of Oswald prior, which
naturally I don't know whether it confused me or made me feel as though I
was taking unfair advantage or what. But with all fairness, I could have positively
identified the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, on December 17 there appears to be another interview that
you had with an agent of the FBI in which you at that time, according to this
report, stated that you could now say that you were sure that Lee Harvey
Oswald was the person you saw in the window at the time of the assassination,
but that when you first saw him in a lineup you felt positive identification was
was not necessary, because it was your understanding that Oswald had already
been charged with the slaying of Officer Tippit, and you also said that another
factor was that you had observed his picture on television prior to the time
of identification, and that that tended to cloud any identification you made of
Oswald at the police department.</p>

<p>Now, does this December 17 interview accurately record what you told the
FBI with regard to that matter of identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, later we have an interview on January 7 with the FBI in
which at that time the interview records that while you were at home and
before you returned to view the lineup, which included the possible assassin of
President Kennedy, you observed Lee Harvey Oswald's picture on television,
and that you said that this, of course, did not help you retain the original
impression of the man in the window with the rifle, but that upon seeing Lee
Harvey Oswald in the police lineup, you felt that Oswald most resembled the
man whom you had seen in the window.</p>

<p>Now, is that what you told the man on January 7&mdash;that Oswald most resembled
the man that you had seen in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does that mean you could not give him a positive identification
at that time, but could merely say he most resembled the man in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I felt that I could. But for personal reasons I didn't
feel like that at that moment it was compulsory and I did not want to give a
positive identification at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, this last interview was on January 7th. You still felt these
personal reasons as recently as January 7th, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No. I felt better about it. This is the first guy <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No. I am referring now to the last interview you had on January
7th, in which it says that you felt that Oswald most resembled the man you
had seen in the window.</p>

<p>Is that what you told them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>You mean told this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On January 7th; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; I don't believe I told this man in those words. I told him
what I had said at the lineup. But he might have misinterpreted that I was
saying that again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words&mdash;well, I don't want to say in other words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
When you said on January 7th that upon seeing Lee Harvey Oswald in
the lineup you felt that Oswald most resembled the man whom you had seen
in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I am referring to a statement to the FBI on January 7th
of this year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By that, did you have reference to your own personal recollection,
or what you said at the time of the Dallas Police Department lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe I was referring to what I said at the Dallas Police
Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On January 7th of this year, what is the fact as to whether or
not you could give&mdash;whether or not you felt on November 22d that the man
you saw in the window was the man you saw in the police lineup&mdash;not what
you told him, but what was the fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. On January 7th, at that time I did believe that I could give
positive identification as well as I did later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean in the December interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this: You said you saw the man with the rifle
on the sixth floor, and then you said you saw some Negroes on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you get as good a look at the Negroes as you got at the man
with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you feel that your recollection of the Negroes at that time was
as good as the one with the man with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes&mdash;at that time, it was. Now&mdash;the boys rode up with me
on the plane&mdash;of course I recognize them now. But as far as a few days later,
I wouldn't positively say that I could identify them. I did identify them
that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, for instance, when I showed you Exhibit 482, you said that
you could not <span class="locked">identify&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, the picture is not clear enough, as far as distinct profiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Belin, I don't think you have asked they be admitted as yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, sir. I have one more mark to make on them, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. The pictures there are not clear enough, the profile is not
distinct enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, I wonder if you would take on Exhibit 482, if you can kind of mark
the way the rifle was at the time you saw it.</p>

<p>Here is a red pencil. If you could put on Exhibit 482 the direction that you
saw the rifle pointing, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I would say more at this angle. Maybe not as far out as this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have put a line, and I have tried to make a little bit darker
line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is as close as I can get it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is on Exhibit 482&mdash;as to the angle at which you saw the
rifle. And you say perhaps it wasn't out of the window as far as this line
goes on Exhibit 482, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is the angle that you believe the rifle was pointed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And that is from the area in the window from which the rifle
was pointing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you tell whether or not any part of the rifle was protruding
out of the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. On a straight view like that it looked like it was.</p>

<p>But as I have told investigating officers prior, a person would have to be
at an angle to tell how much was protruding out of the window. It did look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
at that time that as much was protruding out of the window as there was in
the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At this time, we offer and introduce into evidence Exhibits 480,
481, and 482.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They will be accepted.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 480, 481, and 482 were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I have one or two questions, if you are finished, Mr. Belin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. One more question, sir.</p>

<p>Did you ever tell anyone that you were 90 yards away from that window
where you saw the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No. It was a misunderstanding. My first calculation was that
I was about 75-foot out from the window, and the calculation of the window 75-foot
up. So the hypotenuse there would be approximately 110-foot. That was
my first calculation.</p>

<p>But since we made a step of the grounds Friday, I was farther out than 75
feet. Approximately 93 feet is what we calculated Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. One additional question, sir.</p>

<p>When did you first see Exhibit 479?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. This morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This morning here.</p>

<p>And on Exhibit 479, who picked the person out as being you in that picture?
Was it you or was it I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I did.</p>

<p>I might add that prior to Friday, no one had ever gave me any information
on your evidence whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, on Friday you and I met for the first time in Dallas&mdash;that
would be on March 20th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And we sat down and I asked you just to tell me what happened,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did I ask you a general question and say, "What happened?"
Or did I just ask you repeated questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Well, you more or less told me to tell it in my own way exactly what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you just started to tell it, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. I believe that sums it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then we then went outside where you pointed out the place
where you were sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember the doctor that examined your eyes when you
had them examined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. He is in Port Lavaca. He is the only leading optometrist there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be Dr. Howard R. Bonar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>How did you find that out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Berlin</span>. Well, sir, it is on one of your interviews here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Had that question been asked me before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, it had. On November 22, when you advised that you wore
glasses for reading purposes only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is right, the FBI, Mr. Lish, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That examination was before the sand blasting, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Oh, yes, sir. The sandblasting wasn't until January or early
February of this year.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you have your glasses on at the time of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You can see better at that distance without your glasses than
with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Oh, yes, much better. Oh, I could put these glasses on and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
is just like looking through a window pane. The upper part is just regular
clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you have some questions, Mr. McCloy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes; I have some questions.</p>

<p>You said you went across the street after having sort of jumped off this
retaining wall in order to protect yourself against the possible fusilade of
shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Then you went across and picked up a police officer, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And then you went with him to the steps of the Texas School
Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Eventually, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. How long did it take you, do you think, from the time of the&mdash;when
you first got up&mdash;from the time of the last shot, how long would you
estimate it would be before you got to the steps of the Texas Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I could not calculate that, because before I got to the steps of
the Texas Book Store, I had already talked to this officer, and he had taken me
to the Secret Service men, I had talked to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And you stayed behind the retaining wall for a little while
until you saw the coast was clear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Just seconds. I would say from the time the last shot was
fired, and me diving off the wall there, and getting around on the solid side,
and then running across to the officer, the time element is hard to figure, but
it would still be in seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Then when you got to the officer he took you to a Secret Service
man, and then the Secret Service man and you were on the steps of the depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Well, we talked at the car, and then when these two colored guys came down
the stairway onto the street, I pointed to them, and identified them as being the
two that was in the floor below that floor. And then Mr. Sorrels, I think, had
to give some orders to someone in the book store. He walked me up the steps,
and I stood on the top landing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you were standing on those steps, did you see anyone
pass you, or anyone that you could recognize as being&mdash;as looking somewhat like
the man that you had seen in the window with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you give any estimate&mdash;was it a matter of 5 minutes, 6
minutes, 7 minutes? In general, how long did it take you from the time that
you left where you were protecting yourself to the time you were on the front
steps? What order of magnitude? 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; it was a shorter time than that.</p>

<p>I talked to Mr. Sorrels&mdash;I believe it was Mr. Sorrels&mdash;and the Secret Service
men there&mdash;I don't believe I talked to them more than 3 to 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But you had prior to that time talked to the police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You said the police officer said, "Wait a minute."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. How long was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That was quick, too. He gave his orders to some one on that
side of the building, and then he had taken me to the Secret Service man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you have the feeling that the police had put a cordon
around the building, and were they keeping people in, or were people coming
in and out while you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I did, by the time I got on the steps of the Texas Book
Store&mdash;I felt like that the place was completely surrounded and blocked by
then. But at the time I ran across to this officer, I may have been completely
wrong, they may have&mdash;the Secret Service men and police department, too, may
have been directing their search to the building, but I felt as though they were
directing their search to the west side of the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You testified, I believe, that you saw them directing their search
towards the wrong side of the building, so to speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. That was my thoughts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And so that would indicate that at that time they were not
blocking that particular entrance at the east side of the building, below the
window that you saw the shot fired from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Not according to my calculations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any other questions?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that perhaps in the case
of Mr. Brennan and other witnesses, if a biography prepared by the individual,
looked over by the staff, would not be helpful to include in the record&mdash;I don't
mean a biography in great depth, but at least an outline of the individual's
background&mdash;I think it would be helpful for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We have certain information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We have certain information in the record right now which we
took at the very beginning of the session here this morning.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, I was present. But I think it is important to
have more of a background of his education, experience, and I think it is wise
to have it for all of the witnesses&mdash;not in great depth, but at least a background
to show some biographical information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you care to have that prepared by the witness himself, or
here in the record?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I would suggest that it be prepared initially by the
witness, checked over by the staff, and then mutually agreed as acceptable
through the witness, and then insert it in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Prior to his testimony?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you be willing to furnish us with some kind of an autobiographical
sketch of yourself&mdash;your date and place of birth, where you went
to school, your education, your jobs that you have had, and perhaps it also
should include some kind of a physical description as to your approximate height
and weight and what-have-you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Not at all. But you sure going to be confused on my jobs, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Because you have gone from one job to another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I worked under the union constitution for the last 20
years, and I have worked for many a contractor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean you just work on contract, and when you are through
with that particular construction job, the union would send you to another
construction job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. Usually a contractor wants me to go to the State of
Washington, like I did in California, or he wants me to go to Utah or somewhere
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I don't think we need all that detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, you have been a steamfitter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>With the exception of the possibility of 2 years I was in business in California,
private business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Are you a member of a church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What church are you a member of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Baptist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You testified you were a Bible reader.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, I don't read it as much as I should.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you do, you have to wear glasses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any other questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There have been two or three other questions that have come up
here, sir.</p>

<p>One question&mdash;when we visited on Friday in Dallas, what is the fact as to
whether or not I told you what to say or you yourself just told me what you
wanted to tell me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I told you&mdash;you did not instruct me what to say at all. I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
you in the best words I could to explain exactly my movements and what
happened.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And here today you have testified freely on your own?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Anything you would like to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. One other question, sir.</p>

<p>For the record, would you repeat what I would say would be a full statement
of the reasons which caused you to state in your December interview to the
FBI that you had always been convinced that the man you saw in the lineup was
the man you saw firing the rifle, whereas on November 22d you declined to give
positive identification. Could you give all of the reasons, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, as I previously have said, I had saw the man in the
window and I had saw him on television. He looked much younger on television
than he did from my picture of him in the window&mdash;not much younger,
but a few years younger&mdash;say 5 years younger.</p>

<p>And then I felt that my family could be in danger, and I, myself, might be
in danger. And since they already had the man for murder, that he wasn't
going to be set free to escape and get out of the country immediately, and I
could very easily sooner than the FBI or the Secret Service wanted me, my
testimony in, I could very easily get in touch with them, if they didn't get in
touch with me, and to see that the man didn't get loose.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you got home, about 3 o'clock, on November 22d,
that is when you did get <span class="locked">home&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was your wife there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you and your wife discuss any aspects of the assassination
and your being present, more or less, at the scene of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; we discussed it. We talked&mdash;I talked of moving her
and my grandson, which was living with us at that time and my daughter&mdash;moving
them out of town somewhere in secrecy.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Why did you talk about moving your wife and your
grandson out of town on this afternoon on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Because I had already more or less given a detailed description
of the man, and I talked to the Secret Service and gave them my statement, and
they had convinced me that it would be strictly confidential and all that. But
still I felt like if I was the only eyewitness, that anything could happen to me
or my family.</p>

<p>So that was just about the length of our discussion of it.</p>

<p>She seemed to think that a person can't get away&mdash;wherever they go.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you talk to anybody else between 3 p.m., November
22d and the time when one of the law enforcement agents came out and
picked you up that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Not to tell&mdash;not to give any information out.</p>

<p>My wife and I went to the bank in Mesquite that evening, and my daughter
was at home. And I told her if anyone called to first have them identify themselves,
and find out the nature of their business that they wanted me for, and
if it was the FBI or the Secret Service, to tell them where they could contact me.</p>

<p>And so we were in the bank, I believe, talking to the vice president that
evening. My daughter called and said Mr. Sorrels had called, and that he had
requested her to get the word to me to call him. And she called me at the
bank, and then I asked the secretary to get the number for me. And I called
Mr. Sorrels, and Mr. Sorrels told me there would be a man to pick me up at
6 o'clock promptly.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. 6 p.m., November 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And he did pick you up, and you did go down to the
police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got back from the police station, did you have any
further conversation with your wife about what you saw in the police station?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. But I don't believe I explained to her full details. She
probably remembers whether I did or not, but I don't. I believe I just told her
that I would not identify, make positive identification. I believe that is all I
told her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That you would not, or that you could not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe I told her I would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember the specific color of any shirt that the man with
the rifle was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No, other than light, and a khaki color&mdash;maybe in khaki. I
mean other than light color&mdash;not a real white shirt, in other words. If it was
a white shirt, it was on the dingy side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am handing you what the court reporter has marked as Commission
Exhibit 150.</p>

<p>Does this look like it might or might not be the shirt, or can you make at this
time any positive identification of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I would have expected it to be a little lighter&mdash;a shade or so
lighter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Than Exhibit 150?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Could you see the man's trousers at all?</p>

<p>Do you remember any color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I remembered them at that time as being similar to the same
color of the shirt or a little lighter. And that was another thing that I called
their attention to at the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That he was not dressed in the same clothes that I saw the man
in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean with reference to the trousers or the shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Well, not particularly either. In other words, he just didn't
have the same clothes on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I don't know whether you have that in the record or not. I
am sure you do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any further questions?</p>

<p>I guess there are no more questions, Mr. Belin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, sir, we want to thank you for your cooperation with the
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much for coming here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go to work after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I went to work at Marriott's Motor Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, I started off as a dishwasher. Then they put me on
as a fry cook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. About 6 or 7 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then where did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I went to work at Union Terminal Building, baggage department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you work there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I worked there about a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I was a mail separator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Then I found this job at the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you get that job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Around about September 8th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to go there to get the job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, my wife was expecting, and I just wanted a day job&mdash;I
was working at night. So I just went looking for a day job, and I happened
to come down that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were you going to school in the daytime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This is after you finished school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. All this took place after I finished school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You finished school when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you had these <span class="locked">three&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; and I had a part-time job at a construction company.
I don't remember the name of it. But it was just for about a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you were going to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No. That was the same time I was working at Marriott's
Motel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you work while you went to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I delivered the Dallas morning newspaper sometimes, and
little odd jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did anybody tell you you might get a job at the Texas School
Book Depository before you went down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were just looking for a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I just put in applications everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work did you do when you first went with the Texas
School Book Depository?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think the first day I started work there they started me off
as a wrapper. Then the fellows told me that I had qualifications to be a
checker, so they put me on as a checker there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What are you doing now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. At the present time I do anything&mdash;check, pack, fill orders,
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went to work there, did you work at the building on
the corner of Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir. The first time I went there I was hired on at the
other warehouse, the lower part of Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By lower part, do you mean north of the main building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. Down further, the big white building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is sort of a warehouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to work there. That is about a block, a block and a half
north?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. A block and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. North of the corner of Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long did you work at that place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, I worked there until business began to get slow. I
think that was&mdash;it was before November. I think it was some time during
October. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did they put you to work at at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. They called me up to help lay a floor on the fifth floor, they
wanted more boards over it. As I say, business was slow, and they were trying
to keep us on without laying us off at the time.</p>

<p>So I was using the saw, helping cut wood and lay wood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were laying a wood floor over the old floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when you finished on the fifth floor, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. After we finished on the fifth floor, we started to move up
to the sixth floor. But at the time we didn't complete the sixth floor. We
only completed just a little portion of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By the time, you are talking about November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before November 22d, how long had you been laying floor in the
building at Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Before November 22d, I think we had been working on the
fifth floor, I think, about 3 weeks. I think altogether I had been up there
just about 4 weeks, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long had you been on the sixth floor before&mdash;how long
have you been working on the sixth floor before November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Let's see. Before November 22d, I think it might have been
2 days&mdash;it might have been 2 days. I would say about 2 days, approximately
2 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you started to lay the floor, did you have to move any
cartons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From what part of the sixth floor did you move the cartons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We moved cartons from, I believe, the west side of the
sixth floor to the east side of the sixth floor, because I think there was a
vacancy in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Clear over to the east side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there cartons stacked up between the west side and the east
side&mdash;were there cartons on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you moved the cartons, then did you start laying the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. After we moved the cartons, we started laying the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Then we had to move the cartons.</p>

<p>As we go we would move cartons to vacate the space, so we could lay the
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22d, what time did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. November 22d, I went to work at 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you late or on time that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe I was on time that morning. I always get there a
little before eight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know Lee Oswald, Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I didn't know him personally, but I had seen him working.
Never did say anything to anyone. He never did put himself in any position
to say anything to anyone.</p>

<p>He just went about his work. He never said anything to me. I never said
anything to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever have lunch with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No.</p>

<p>The only time he would come into the lunchroom sometimes and eat a sandwich
maybe, and then he would go for a walk, and he would go out. And I
assume he would come back. But the only other time he would come in and
read a paper or nothing, and laugh and leave again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But he would never say good morning or good evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. He never would speak to anyone. He was just a funny fellow.
I don't know what kind of a fellow he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice what he read in the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe one morning I noticed he was reading something
about politics, and as he was reading this he acted like it was funny to him.
He would read a paragraph or two, smile, or laugh, then throw the paper down
and get up and walk out.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where did this go on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. This was going on in what we call the domino room. This is
where we would eat our lunch and play dominoes. Some fellow would bring
newspapers, to read the sports or something. He never would read the sports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The domino room is a little recreation room on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you see the map there which has been marked Commission
Exhibit 362. Will you point on that map the location of the domino room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would it be easier if we put the map up there, and then everybody
could see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. In the front entrance&mdash;I could explain the way I know the best.</p>

<p>As I said, this would be the main entrance from Elm Street. Well, this
would be&mdash;the domino room is in the same line with Mr. Shelley's office, and
Mr. Truly's office. The domino room would be right in here. Because two bathrooms,
a large one and a small one right in this vicinity here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is marked on the map&mdash;the domino room is marked on the
map as rec room, and the toilet is shown there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. And there is a small one on the other side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is on Exhibit 362.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What floor is this we are looking at now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That is the first floor.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And it was in the rec room or domino room where you
saw Oswald read the paper on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And you said he read some of it to you and smiled about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No; he didn't read it to me. We were waiting turns to play
dominoes, and I happened to glance over. And I just noticed what he was
reading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this morning, did you see Oswald on the floor at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. This morning of November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. The morning of November 22d Oswald was on the floor. The
only time I saw him that morning was a little after eight, after I had started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
working. As usual, he was walking around with a clipboard in his hands, I
believe he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes. He had a clipboard in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the only time you saw him that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That is the only time I saw him that morning. I saw him
again between 11:30 and maybe 10 until 12:00.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will come to that in a moment.</p>

<p>Where did you work that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That morning I worked on the sixth floor. I think we went
directly up to the sixth floor and I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how many were working on the sixth floor with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe there were five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What are their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, Bill Shelley, Charles Givens, and there was a fellow
by the name of Danny Arce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He is a Mexican boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes. And a fellow by the name of Billy Lovelady, and myself.
And there was a fellow that came up&mdash;his name was Harold Norman.
He really wasn't working at the time, but there wasn't anything to do, he would
come around to help a little bit, and then back down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was he in the employ of the company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; he had been working there at the time about 2 years, I
think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But he wasn't on this particular detail on the sixth floor that
you are speaking of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, he had been helping us on the fifth floor. When the
orders would come in, he would go down and help with the orders, and when
he didn't have anything else to do he would come back and help us move stock
around.</p>

<p>I think that was him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What part of the sixth floor were you working that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. On the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you moving stock or laying floor that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We were doing both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were doing both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The west side of the sixth floor&mdash;you mean the whole west side,
or was there a certain part&mdash;northwest or southwest or middle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe it was the whole west side, because we had to go from
window to window&mdash;from the elevator to the front window facing Elm Street&mdash;we
were laying the floor parallel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Oswald on the sixth floor that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I am not sure. I think I saw him once messing around with
some cartons or something, back over the east side of the building. But he
wasn't in the window that they said he shot the President from. He was more
on the east side of the elevator, I think, messing around with cartons, because
he always just messed around, kicking cartons around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. His job was an order filler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I mean by that an order filler&mdash;when orders come in for the
State schools mostly, from Austin, he would take the orders and fill the orders.</p>

<p>If the orders called for a certain amount of books, he would fill that order, and
turn it in to be checked, to be shipped out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say he would fill the order. He would go and get books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. He would get books. As an order filler you had access to all
the floors, all seven floors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were the cartons that you are talking about containers of books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would a checker&mdash;would an order filler go to the different floors and
take books out of cartons?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. The order filler would have to, in order to fill the
order&mdash;he would have to move around to each floor, and take the books that he
needs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then where would he take the books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Down to the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. The first floor is where the checkers, the freight, and all&mdash;they
are checking the books to go out, and also where they wrap the books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were there certain men down there wrapping books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Certain men wrapping, checking, weighing, et cetera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you have a schedule somewhere posted up so that you knew
which books were on which floor when an order came in? You would know
whether to go to the sixth floor or what floor to go to get the particular books
that were wanted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, as I remember, I don't know too much about the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were not in the order filling business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; not in that department.</p>

<p>At the other building. I was just transferred to that building.</p>

<p>I don't think you really had any schedule to go by, or anything to show you
where the books were. You just asked the older fellows that had been there
were certain books&mdash;if you are looking for a certain book, they would tell you
where to find it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This morning, when you think you saw Oswald on the sixth floor,
can you tell us about where he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, as I said before, I am not sure that he was really on the
sixth floor. But he was always around that way. In the place I think I saw him
was as the east elevator come up to the sixth floor, he was on that side of the
elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here a diagram of the sixth floor which I will have marked
as Exhibit 483.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 483 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. First of all, this is Houston Street, and the top is north&mdash;east and
west. Here is Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. This would be the east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is the east elevator, west elevator and the stairway.</p>

<p>Now, can you take this and show us about where your men were working
laying floor on that sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I would <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. First of all, you take this pencil and put it down there, and then
we will make the markings afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. This is the west side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The area where you were laying floor. Make the outside limits of
the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We were working in this area down there like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, from there to the west, or where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We were working from the west coming this way, coming to
the east. And we had got about just so much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, let's draw a dark line down there. This marks the area that
you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had already laid floor from the west side to the dark line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were working right around in the dark line area, were
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, take your pencil and show us about where it was that you
saw Oswald that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think I saw Oswald somewhere around in this vicinity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
As I was up by this other elevator, I think one time I saw him over there. I
am not really sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have drawn a line here. This is a sort of general area where
you say you saw Oswald, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will mark that as "O". That is on the north side of the floor
near the east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will mark that "O".</p>

<p>Now, these lines you have marked show your area where you were working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will mark that W-1 and W-1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Williams, were all the boxes of books moved out of this
area while you were working, or as you finished a part of it, were some boxes
put back in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. To begin with, I think we were working on the wall first. I
don't think we moved too many books in this area. I think we just moved
them out and right back in, as I remember.</p>

<p>But I think after we got a little further over, I think we had to move some
books. We had to move these books to the east side of this building, over here,
and those books&mdash;I would say this would be the window Oswald shot the President
from. We moved these books kind of like in a row like that, kind of winding
them around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is moving them from the west towards the east of the
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The window was here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any other questions on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of day do you think it was you saw Oswald, if
you can remember? If you can't remember, don't guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I cannot remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you knock off work for the lunch hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, approximately&mdash;between 11:30 to 12, around in there.
I wouldn't say the exact time, because I don't remember the exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time do you usually quit for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We always quit about 5 minutes before time.</p>

<p>During the rush season we quit about 5 minutes before time and washup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wash your hands and face before you eat lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say quit 5 minutes before time. What is the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Five before 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you quit earlier this day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe this day we quit about maybe 5 or 10 minutes, because
all of us were so anxious to see the President&mdash;we quit a little ahead of
time, so that we could wash up and we wanted to be sure we would not miss
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you go downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We took two elevators down. I mean, speaking as a group,
we took two down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there some reason you took two down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We always had a little kids game we played racing down with
the elevators. And I think one fellow, Charles Givens, had the east elevator,
and me, and I think two or three more fellows had the west elevator. And we
was racing down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was driving the west side elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I don't remember exactly who was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I don't think I was. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was driving the east side elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think that was Charles Givens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did something happen on the way down&mdash;did somebody yell
out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; on the way down I heard Oswald&mdash;and I am not sure
whether he was on the fifth or the sixth floor. But on the way down Oswald
hollered "Guys, how about an elevator?" I don't know whether those are his
exact words. But he said something about the elevator.</p>

<p>And Charles said, "Come on, boy," just like that.</p>

<p>And he said, "Close the gate on the elevator and send the elevator back up."</p>

<p>I don't know what happened after that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Had the elevator gone down below the floor from which
he yelled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; I believe it was. I assume it was the fifth or the sixth.</p>

<p>The reason I could not tell whether it was the sixth or the fifth is because
I was on the opposite elevator, and if you are not thinking about it it is kind
of hard to judge which floor, if you started moving.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The elevator did not go back up to the floor from
which he yelled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he ask the gate be closed on the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think he asked Charles Givens&mdash;I think he said, "Close the
gate on the elevator, or send one of the elevators back up."</p>

<p>I think that is what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is in order that he would have an elevator to come down
when he wanted to come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 23d of November 1963, you talked to two FBI agents according
to the record I have here, Bardwell Odum and Will Griffin, and they reported
that you said that as they were going down, that you saw Lee on the fifth
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I told him the fifth or the sixth. I told him I wasn't sure
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you sure at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. About which floor it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you sure today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I am not sure today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you think it was the fifth or the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you sure it was Oswald you talked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I am sure it was Oswald. I didn't talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you heard him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I heard him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went down to the first floor.</p>

<p>What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We went down to the first floor. I think the first thing I did,
I washed up, then I went into the domino room where I kept my lunch, and I
got my lunch, came back out and went back up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you carry your lunch that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you usually carry your lunch to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was your habit, carrying your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that day, on November 22d, how did you carry your lunch
from home to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I carried my lunch from home to work in a brown paper bag.
I believe it was size No. 6 or maybe 8&mdash;paper bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Number 6 or 8 size paper bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Small bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Like you get in the grocery store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you have in your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I had a chicken sandwich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Describe the sandwich. What did it have in it besides chicken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, it just had chicken in it. Chicken on the bone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Chicken on the bone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The chicken was not boned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. It was just chicken on the bone. Just plain old chicken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it have bread around it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you went upstairs, did you get anything to drink?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I got a small bottle of Dr. Pepper from the Dr. Pepper machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have anything else in your lunch besides chicken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I had a bag of Fritos, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No; I believe that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you went back upstairs. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I went back up to the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you go to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, at the time everybody was talking like they was going
to watch from the sixth floor. I think Billy Lovelady said he wanted to watch
from up there. And also my friend; this Spanish boy, by the name of Danny
Arce, we had agreed at first to come back up to the sixth floor. So I thought
everybody was going to be on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody go back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Nobody came back up. So I just left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you eat your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I ate my lunch&mdash;I am not sure about this, but the third or the
fourth set of windows, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Facing on what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Facing Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You ate your lunch on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And you were all alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you sit on while you ate your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. First of all, I remember there was some boxes behind me. I
just kind of leaned back on the boxes first. Then I began to get a little impatient,
because there wasn't anyone coming up. So I decided to move to a
two-wheeler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A two-wheeler truck, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. I remember sitting on this two-wheeler.</p>

<p>By that time, I was through, and I got up and I just left then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How much of the room could you see as you finished your lunch
there? Was your view obstructed by boxes of books, or could you see a good
bit of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, at the time I couldn't see too much of the sixth floor,
because the books at the time were stacked so high. I could see only in the
path that I was standing&mdash;as I remember, I could not possibly see anything to
the east side of the building.</p>

<p>But just one aisle, the aisle I was standing in I could see just about to the
west side of the building. So far as seeing to the east and behind me, I could
only see down the aisle behind me and the aisle to the west of me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you ever had any trouble with the law at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No difficulty as far as the law is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I have never been inside of a courthouse before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have an exhibit here marked 484.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 484 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I recognize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I see a two-wheeler, a Dr. Pepper bottle, and some boxes in the
windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And is that anywhere near where you were sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; that is the exact place I was sitting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the two-wheeler you were sitting on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when you were on the two-wheeler, as you were sitting
there, did you have a view, could you see down towards the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I couldn't see anything as I remember there. About
the only thing that I could see from there would be just the top edge of the
window, because the boxes were stacked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The boxes were stacked up high?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me show you another picture here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are not introducing that at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will. I am going to introduce them all.</p>

<p>Let's go back to the diagram, which is 483. Could you mark on this diagram
the window that is shown in this picture 484&mdash;that is, the place where
you were sitting and eating your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That would be facing Elm Street. I would say right around
in this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you are marking here something between&mdash;some
area between the third and the fourth window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are not able to tell exactly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The witness has drawn a red rectangle to show the approximate
area which runs from about the center of the second row of windows from the
southeast corner over to about the fourth pane of windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I would say about right in here, third or fourth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Third or fourth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you have made two marks, so I will identify the last mark.
Between the third and fourth, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will mark the rectangle, and we will mark it "W-3" and "W-4"
the end of the lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What time of day was this, when you were eating your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. About 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Just 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, as you looked towards the southeast corner from where
you were sitting, could you see the windows in the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. In the southeast&mdash;that is&mdash;the southeast. I really don't remember
if I seen anything&mdash;it would be just the top edge of the window,
as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anyone else up there that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I was there from&mdash;5, 10, maybe 12 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Finish your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. No longer than it took me to finish the chicken
sandwich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you eat the chicken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you put the bones?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I don't remember exactly, but I think I put some of them
back in the sack. Just as I was ready to go I threw the sack down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with the sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think I just dropped it there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anywhere near the two-wheeler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with the Dr. Pepper bottle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Just set it down on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a pop bottle that you see in the picture, 484&mdash;does that
look like anything like the pop bottle that you were drinking from that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe that was the bottle&mdash;I believe. I am not sure. But
it looks like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you leave the bottle somewhere near the point shown of the
bottle shown on 484?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I am really not sure about it. I don't think I left it there.
I am not sure. I think I left it sitting up on top of the boxes, right to the
side of the two-wheeler. As I remember&mdash;I am not sure about it. It is possible
that I could have put it there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your memory is that the Dr. Pepper bottle was left on top of
the boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Beg pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your memory is that you left the Dr. Pepper bottle on top of
some of the cartons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. As I remember. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is shown there on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go when you left there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I went down to the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you get down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I took an elevator down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't go down the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which elevator did you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I took the east elevator down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the one that is worked with a <span class="locked">hand&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. That is the one with the one gate, and works with
the hand pedal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How does the other one work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. The other one worked by push button. You have two gates
to pull. That is the one you can pull two gates on and it will come back up
by itself. The east side elevator won't come up unless someone is operating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took the elevator from the sixth floor to the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you intend to go when you left the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I intended to stop on the fifth floor, and if there wasn't
anyone there, I intended to get out of the building, go outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you stopped on the fifth floor. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Beg pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you stop on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. To see if there was anyone there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know there was anyone there before you started down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, I thought I heard somebody walking, the windows
moving or something. I said maybe someone is down there, I said to myself.
And I just went on down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you find anybody there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. As I remember, when I was walking up, I think Harold
Norman and James Jarman&mdash;as I remember, they was down facing the Elm
Street on the fifth floor, as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I want to call your attention to another report I have here.</p>

<p>On the 23d of November 1963, the report of Mr. Odum and Mr. Griffin, FBI
agents, is that you told them that you went from the sixth floor to the fifth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
floor using the stairs at the west end of the building. Did you tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I didn't tell them I was using the stairs. I came back down
to the fifth floor in the same elevator I came up to the sixth floor on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, also, on January 14th, did you remember talking to a couple
of agents named Carter and Griffin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I can't remember their names, but I am sure I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You talked to a good many of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, they reported here that you went down to the fifth floor, and
you did so by going down on the west elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. The east elevator. The reason I was able to determine
whether it was the east elevator is because I think when you questioned us
the other day, the other fellows&mdash;I told you I didn't remember which elevator
first. But the other fellows said they had the west elevator. There are only
two elevators. If they are sure they had the west elevator up, that only
leaves the east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got to the fifth floor and left the elevator, at that time
were both elevators on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Both west and east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir, as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The other day, when I talked to you in Dallas, on Friday 20
<span class="locked">March&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And at that time were you able&mdash;did you remember which elevator
it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Which elevator I had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What you had come down from six to five on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. As I remember, I first said I wasn't sure. After the fellows
said they brought the west elevator up, I said I must have the east
elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it fair to say now that you don't have any definite memory
as to whether it was the east or west elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. I believe that would be true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did bring an elevator up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when you came down there and got off that elevator, did
you notice that the other elevator was also on that floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, at the time I didn't notice it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you, later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got off the elevator, you went over to the front of the
building, the Elm Street side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you saw Norman <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Ball, could we get the time element?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I am going to bring that in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right. I will bide my time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went over to the front of the building, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you saw your two friends, Norman and Jarman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had known them before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you know what time that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I do not know the exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. It was after I had left the sixth floor, after I had eaten the
chicken sandwich. I finished the chicken sandwich maybe 10 or 15 minutes
after 12. I could say approximately what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Approximately what time was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Approximately 12:20, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, now, when you talked to the FBI on the 23d day of November,
you said that you went up to the sixth floor about 12 noon with your lunch,
and you stayed only about 3 minutes, and seeing no one you came down to
the fifth floor, using the stairs at the west end of the building.</p>

<p>Now, do you think you stayed longer than 3 minutes up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I am sure I stayed longer than 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember telling the FBI you only stayed 3 minutes up
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I do not remember telling them I only stayed 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then on this 14th of January 1964, when you talked to Carter
and Griffin, they reported that you told them you went down to the fifth
floor around 12:05 p.m., and that around 12:30 p.m. you were watching the
Presidential parade.</p>

<p>Now, do you remember telling them you went down there about 12:05 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I remember telling the fellows that&mdash;they asked me first,
they said, "How long did it take you to finish the sandwich?" I said, "Maybe
5 to 10 minutes, maybe 15 minutes." Just like I said here. I don't remember
saying for a definite answer that it was 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, is it fair to say that you do not remember the exact time
now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You do remember, though, that you ate your lunch and drank your
pop, your Doctor Pepper, before you came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you there any length of time before the Presidential parade
came by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, sir, on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the fifth floor, yes, with your two friends, Norman and Jarman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I was there a while before it came around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were at what window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, I believe we was on the east side of the window, and
I think Hank was&mdash;I think he was directly under the sixth floor window where
Oswald was supposed to have shot the President from. And I think I was a
window over. And I think James Jarman was two or three windows over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you a picture here, which is 482. Do you see yourself
in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I am right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Draw a dark line down there towards you and put
an arrow on the end. I will mark that W; the arrow W on 482 points to you,
Bonnie Ray Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that about the way you were sitting in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were watching the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I don't remember whether I was watching the parade here
or not. But I was in the window, that window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recognize the man in the window to the right of us as we
look at the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; that is Harold Norman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, here is another photograph which is 480, giving more of the
front of the building. Can you tell us in what window your friend Jarman
was sitting, or watching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe this is James Jarman right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Draw a line down to that on 480. Draw an arrow to the
window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will mark that W on 480.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Now, were you boys sitting down or standing up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Are you referring to the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No, I am talking about your memory now as to what you were
doing at the time you were watching for the Presidential parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. At the time we were watching for the President's parade, I believe
I was in a squat position. But I don't remember whether I was on my
knees or just squatting on the balls of my feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When the parade went by, how were you&mdash;squatting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. As the parade went by, I was in a squat position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Last Friday you went up to the sixth floor, or the fifth floor with us,
and a photographer, and you three men got into position, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To have your pictures taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I can only ask you about your position. First of all, we will mark
this as 485.</p>

<p>(The photograph was marked Commission Exhibit No. 485 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will mark this photograph as 486.</p>

<p>(The photograph was marked Exhibit No. 486 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 485 is a picture of three men. You were there when that picture
was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who are the men who are there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. First of all in the corner of the east of the building is Harold
Norman. Secondly, the fellow over from me, that would be James Jarman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is the man in the center?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That is me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that about the way you were sitting when you watched the
parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe it was at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I show you 486 and who are the men in that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. In this picture here, 486&mdash;this fellow&mdash;the other fellow in the
corner, in the east of the building, is Harold Norman. I am in the window
next to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your back is to the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that about the position you were in when the President's parade
went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what do you remember happened when the President's
parade went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, to the best of my ability, what I remember was first
coming off of&mdash;I believe it was Main Street&mdash;well, two motorcycle policemen
came around. I think it was two or maybe three. They came around first. And
then I think the President's car followed. And I believe a car was behind it
carrying the Vice President, as I remember. I am not sure about it. President
Kennedy was sitting in the back seat. I believe his wife was in the back seat.
I believe Governor Connally was sitting in the front seat of the car as it was
going down the street&mdash;I <span class="locked">believe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What street are you talking about there? Are you talking
about Main Street, Houston Street, or Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. First of all, as I say, they was coming off of Main Street.
Then as it turned the corner, the corner which I am speaking of, most people
refer to it as Elm Street. But it is not really Elm Street. I believe it is the
start of the turnpike, because Elm Street runs parallel with the building, but
comes to a dead end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the parade come up Houston, north on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you saw it turn to the left in front of your building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now tell us what happened after the President's car had passed
your window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. After the President's car had passed my window, the last
thing I remember seeing him do was, you know&mdash;it seemed to me he had a
habit of pushing his hair back. The last thing I saw him do was he pushed his
hand up like this. I assumed he was brushing his hair back. And then the
thing that happened then was a loud shot&mdash;first I thought they were saluting
the President, somebody&mdash;even maybe a motorcycle backfire. The first shot&mdash;there
was two shots rather close together. The second and the third shot was
closer together than the first shot and the second shot, as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, was your head out the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I could not say for sure. I do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice&mdash;where did you think the shots came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, the first shot&mdash;I really did not pay any attention to it,
because I did not know what was happening. The second shot, it sounded
like it was right in the building, the second and third shot. And it sounded&mdash;it
even shook the building, the side we were on. Cement fell on my head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say cement fell on your head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Cement, gravel, dirt, or something, from the old building,
because it shook the windows and everything. Harold was sitting next to me,
and he said it came right from over our head. If you want to know my exact
words, I could tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. My exact words were, "No bull shit." And we jumped up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Norman said what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. He said it came directly over our heads. "I can even hear
the shell being ejected from the gun hitting the floor." But I did not hear the
shell being ejected from the gun, probably because I wasn't paying attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Norman said he could hear it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. He said he could hear it. He was directly under the window
that Oswald shot from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was directly under. He told you as he got up from the window
that he could hear the shells ejected from the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After he made the statement that you mentioned, he thought it
came from overhead, and you made some statement, did Jarman say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think Jarman, he&mdash;I think he moved before any of us. He
moved towards us, and he said, "Man, somebody is shooting at the President."
And I think I said again. "No bull shit." And then we all kind of got excited,
you know, and, as I remember, I don't remember him saying that he thought
the shots came from overhead. But we all decided we would run down to the
west side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You ran down to the west side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Ran down to the west side? You mean you were still
on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; we were on the fifth floor, the east side of the building.
We saw the policemen and people running, scared, running&mdash;there are some
tracks on the west side of the building, railroad tracks. They were running
towards that way. And we thought maybe&mdash;well, to ourself, we know the shots
practically came from over our head. But since everybody was running, you
know, to the west side of the building, towards the railroad tracks, we assumed
maybe somebody was down there. And so we all ran that way, the way that
the people was running, and we was looking out the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When the cement fell on your head, did either one of the men
notice it and say anything about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. I believe Harold was the first one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is Hank Norman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe he was the first one. He said "Man, I know it came
from there. It even shook the building." He said, "You got something on your
head." And then James Jarman said, "Yes, man, don't you brush it out."
By that time I just forgot about it. But after I got downstairs I think I brushed
it out anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Jarman is called Junior?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did Norman say anything about hearing the bolt of the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I don't remember him saying anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you heard him say he could hear the cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I heard Harold Norman&mdash;pardon me, I thought you were
saying James Jarman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Norman say anything about the bolt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes. He said he could hear the rifle, and it sounded like it
was right above. He said he could hear the rifle being ejected, the shells
hitting the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you could not hear this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No; I could not hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was an old floor, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you see light through the floor from the fifth to the sixth
floor as you would look above your window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, at the time, that day of November 22d, I did not notice
that. But the other day when you were questioning me, even after the thick
new floor that was put over the old floor on the sixth floor, well, you still could
see light. And the new floor extended a little beyond the old floor. So therefore
I would say that you could see light much more when the old floor was
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you were there the other day, you looked up through a
crack in the ceiling of the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you see the new floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. You could. You could see daylight through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, where was that crack with reference to the wall of the fifth
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. With reference to the wall of the fifth floor, the crack that
I was speaking about was directly over my head, and also directly over Norman's
head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that would be where the floor would ordinarily make a joint
with the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. With the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you ran down to the west window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. First of <span class="locked">all&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will take this same <span class="locked">diagram&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. First of all we made a stop before we got to the last stop that
we was when the policeman came up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes. That is where I want you to show me now, where you made
the stop. This is the fifth floor diagram.</p>

<p>We will mark the fifth floor diagram as Exhibit 487.</p>

<p>(The document so described was marked Commission Exhibit No. 487 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is Elm Street on 487, and here are the windows where you
have shown us you were standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, will you show us the direction that you ran and also point
to the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. The direction that we ran after we heard the shots was&mdash;I
would say I was in about this position here, this window. And we left like this.
Harold was coming from here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me show you the diagram. Here are these two pair of windows
that are shown here on this diagram. This is the corner. Here is the
next window, and here is the next window.</p>

<p>Now, take the pencil and show where you were and where you ran to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I was right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mark an X, and bring it on down, and show us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I left here, and I came like this. The other fellows followed
like this. We all was running this direction here. And I believe when we
got to this point here, we stopped. And I am not sure, but I think James
Jarman, he raised this window, this corner window here, and we all huddled
in this corner window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will mark that window Y. And then you ran from X to Y,
you three men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the window open or closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think it was closed at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it opened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe James Jarman opened the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the other day, when you were up here, you three men went
to that window and stood there and had your picture taken, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This window which you have shown as Y, in 487, the diagram of
the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is 488.</p>

<p>(The document so described was marked Commission Exhibit No. 488 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And is that about the way you were standing as you looked out to
the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That is about the way we were standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you run fast towards the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We did. We moved rather fast. We was at a trotting pace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was that to get a better view of the President's party in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I don't think&mdash;we knew the President had been shot
at at that time. The car was gone, you know. It has speeded up and left.
But the people, as I said before, the policemen and people were running towards
the tracks. The tracks are at this side of the building. We wondered why they
were running that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How did you know the President was shot at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We heard the shots, and we assumed somebody had shot him.
And we decided to run down that way.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Why didn't you go up to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I really don't know. We just never did think about it. And
after we had made this last stop, James Jarman said, "Maybe we better get the
hell out of here." And so we just ran down to the fourth floor, and came on
down. We never did think about it, going up to the sixth floor. Maybe it
was just because we were frightened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you know the President had been hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, personally I did not know he had been hit, but I think
Harold&mdash;I remember&mdash;I don't know whether he said or not&mdash;but I think he
said he saw him slump. So from that I think we all assumed he had been
shot at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. One of the other two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I believe that is what he said. Anyway, we knew
he had been shot at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you left this corner window in the southwest corner that
we have shown you the picture of as 488, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Then we moved over to another window on the west side of
the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's go back to the diagram of the fifth floor, 487, and you show
me where that window was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. It was one of these windows, I believe it was this window
here, I believe. Maybe it was this window. I would say this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. We will mark that Z&mdash;window Z.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the other day, Friday, March 20th, when we were in Dallas,
you three men went to that same window, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you had your picture taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is 489.</p>

<p>(The described document was marked Commission Exhibit No. 489 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you go there and look in that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Because, as I said before, the policeman was running toward
the tracks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The tracks shown in this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. I believe that is the parking lot right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the tracks are shown in there, aren't they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were people running towards the tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; the policemen were.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Ball, I hate to interrupt, but I do have to go to a
call of the House. I wonder if I could ask one question right here. I dislike
breaking up the sequence.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams, when did you first know that the President's motorcade would
come by the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, I never did know the exact time. But I think my wife
had mentioned it before that Friday. She had told me, because I never did
have too much time reading the paper. And that morning, that Friday morning,
we was on the sixth floor, and I think some fellows mentioned it to me again,
some of the fellows working with me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You did not know the motorcade was coming by your
building until Friday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I didn't know the exact way it was coming, because I
hadn't been reading the papers.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You had not read the paper the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. About the only thing I would read in the paper in the mornings
before I leave home would be the sports.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it discussed in the building that morning of November
22d that the motorcade was coming by the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe I heard a couple of fellows say&mdash;I don't remember
exactly who it was&mdash;but I believe I heard them say the motorcade was coming
around that way.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But it was not until Friday that you personally knew
it was coming by the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I would like to ask one question here.</p>

<p>When you were on the sixth floor eating your lunch, did you hear anything
that made you feel that there was anybody else on the sixth floor with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I didn't hear anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You did not see anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I did not see anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were all alone as far as you knew at that time on the sixth
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. During that period of from 12 o'clock about to&mdash;10 or 15 minutes
after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. I felt like I was all alone. That is one of the
reasons I left&mdash;because it was so quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you saw Oswald that morning, was he carrying any
package? Did you see any bundle or package with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I didn't see anything other than the clipboard with
the orders on it that he was filling, as I remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. How many shots did you hear fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I heard three shots. But at first I told the FBI I only heard
two&mdash;they took me down&mdash;because I was excited, and I couldn't remember too
well. But later on, as everything began to die down, I got my memory even a
little better than on the 22d, I remembered three shots, because there was a
pause between the first two shots. There was two real quick. There was
three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anything upstairs at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I didn't hear anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any footsteps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir. Probably the reason we didn't hear anything is
because, you know, after the shots we were running, too, and that was making
a louder noise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You really ran?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; we ran. And that was probably making a lot of
noise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I'm going to hold this up. I don't know whether everybody
can see it or <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question in connection with your last question?</p>

<p>Did you hear either of the elevators going up or down while you were eating
your meal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You didn't hear the elevators at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. If an elevator had come to that floor, would you have heard
it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That all <span class="locked">depends&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were they noisy elevators? The operation of the doors and
so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. The elevator that I came up on to the sixth floor,
if you would listen&mdash;say you were listening for the boss, you could hear, because
you would be paying attention. The elevator is worked by hand pedal. When
you release the hand pedal it makes a noise. It bangs&mdash;or maybe you can
hear the old elevator when it is first coming up. But at that time I did not
hear anything.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to point out over in the northwest corner there is a
stairwell. And the elevators are shown here. And the witness has placed
himself at point "Z" on Exhibit 487, which is near a pair of west windows.</p>

<p>Now, you are oriented there, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. When you were at "Z" were you able to see the stairwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. You could not see the stairs from that point because this
other&mdash;this is the stairway, and it has some shelves made out of some old
wooden boxes. Those old wooden boxes come out to about right here. And
they come out maybe 5 feet, even more than that, past the stairway. And that
would block your view of the stairway from that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mark it in there with your pencil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. These are the stairs. I would say the bookcase would come
out like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The shelf we will mark "WX", both ends of the shelf. How high
is the shelf?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Pretty high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does it go to the ceiling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. As I remember, they do not go exactly to the ceiling. But I
am 6 feet, and they are way over me, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, could you see all of the elevators from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, by me being the tallest, I <span class="locked">saw&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I am not going into what you saw. But could you see either elevator
from where you were standing at "Z"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; you could see this pretty plainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the west elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you see the east elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; you could not see it exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when you were questioned by the FBI agents, talking to Mr.
Odum and Mr. Griffin, they reported in writing here that while you were standing
at the west end of the building on the fifth floor, a police officer came up on
the elevator and looked all around the fifth floor and left the floor. Did you
see anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, at the time I was up there I saw a motorcycle policeman.
He came up. And the only thing I saw of him was his white helmet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. He just came around, and around to the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I believe it was the east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were only able to see the top of his helmet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You could only see the top of his helmet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; that is the only thing I saw about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They reported that you told them on the 23d of November that
you and Hank, that is Hank Norman, isn't <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Junior&mdash;that is Junior Jarman&mdash;were standing where they
would have seen anyone coming down from the sixth floor by way of the stairs.
Did you tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I could not possibly have told him that, because you cannot
see anything coming down from that position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that you did not see anyone coming down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir. An elephant could walk by there, and you could
not see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That day we were out there, Friday, March 20th, we took some
pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you 490.</p>

<p>(The document described was marked Exhibit No. 490 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We took a picture from where you were standing towards the
stairs. Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. This is the side we were on. I believe these are the bookshelves
I was speaking of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the ones that hide the stairwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the camera is&mdash;you saw where the camera was set, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw these pictures taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. The camera was located about the exact place I was standing
looking out this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be "Z" on 487?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And was pointed toward what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. It was pointed towards the stairway and the bookcase.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The way you would have been looking on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And this shows those shelves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have two other pictures I would like to show, and I would like
to show the Commissioners all three at the same time.</p>

<p>Now, do you recall that we had you three men stand near the stairwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on this picture here, on 487, that would be what location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. On this picture here, that would be about right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Near the "up", is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to have the Commissioners note that&mdash;that the man
was standing near the "up" part of the stairwell.</p>

<p>We took your pictures three in a row, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then do you recall the picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I recall this picture. This picture was taken from
the position we were standing, and it gave the view of&mdash;the only thing you
would be able to see from this point. And this picture here was James Jarman,
which we were standing shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Also were the cartons piled at that time so that&mdash;as they were
here&mdash;on the day, November 22d, were the cartons piled somewhat like they
are here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. They were piled somewhat like here, because they have been
rearranged since that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in both pictures, 492 and 490, you see two windows, do you
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And those windows are shown on the diagram of the fifth floor,
487, as where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The windows next to the west elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in this picture, are you able to see either elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. In this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This picture&mdash;490 and 492&mdash;are you able to see either elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; you cannot see exactly the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in this picture, 491, where is the downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. The downstairs come right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you able to see the opening of the downstairs from this view,
492?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the thing that obstructs your view is this shelving, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How long has that shelving been there&mdash;for quite a long while?
Or was it put there recently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think it was there from the time I started, as far as I
can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That goes back to the time you were first employed there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. At the time I came to the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So it could not have been put up a day or two before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anyone going up or down the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pay any attention to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As you were standing at the window, did you hear any footsteps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Up above&mdash;hear any movement up above?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you paying any attention whether or not there was anyone
up above?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; we wasn't paying any attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in this FBI report that we have dated the 23d of November
1963, the report that you said that someone might have been coming down
on the elevator and you would not have noticed that. Did you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I think I remember saying that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you stood at the west window for a while, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. After we stood at the west window for a while, we decided
to go down. Then we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you go down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. By stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. We went to the fourth floor first. Then we paused for a
minute there, where we saw these women looking out of the window. Then
we decided to go down to the first floor, and we ran on down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got to the first floor, what did you see there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. How did you get to the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. By stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There were some people on the fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir. I remember seeing maybe two or three women
standing in the window, looking out the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Looking out the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Which stairway did they take, west or east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was only one stairway, and that is the one in the corner.</p>

<p>Did you run down stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; we ran.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got to the first floor, what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. When we arrived to the first floor, the first thing I noticed
was that the policemen had rushed in. I think some firemen came in with a
water hose. And then the next thing that happened, these detectives, or maybe
FBI&mdash;anyway, they stopped us all and they said, "Do you work here?" And
we told them yes. And they took our name, address, and they searched everybody.
And then the other fellow&mdash;I think one fellow asked whether we had
been working upstairs. I think we told him yes. They got out all the fellows
I think that was working on the sixth floor at the time, and they took us all
down to the courthouse, I think, and we had to fill out some affidavits and
things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You made out an affidavit there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go out of the building shortly after you came downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. They wouldn't let anybody out of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long after you came down from the first floor were you taken
over to the Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I couldn't give you the exact time, but it wasn't long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You can't give me any estimate in minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I would not want to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you see Lee Oswald at any time during this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I don't remember seeing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the police with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were your two friends with you, Jarman <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No; they wasn't with me. First I think they took me and
another fellow, Danny&mdash;they took us in one car. Then they took some other
fellows in another car, and then another car, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were with Danny Arce and one or two police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know when Norman and Jarman went out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, at the time I don't think Norman and Jarman came down
right then. They brought Bill Shelley and Bill Lovelady, a fellow by the name
of Jack Dougherty, and Charles Givens later on, they brought them right behind
us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you left the first floor with the officers, was Norman still
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; he was in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And was Jarman still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to offer all of the exhibits that we marked so far into
evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you give me the numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think they run 483 to 492, inclusive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was 481 introduced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If 481 and 482 were not, we offer them. 483 is a diagram of the
sixth floor. We offer that. Everything this morning from 477 to 492 we offer
in evidence. The last number is 492.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All exhibits subsequent to the last exhibit noted in the record
up to and including 492 will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The material heretofore marked Exhibits Nos. 481 through 492, inclusive,
previously marked for identification, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I have some questions.</p>

<p>When you came downstairs, do you remember seeing a man named Brennan,
and did a man named Brennan identify you downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I don't remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. No one that you know&mdash;no one said, "This is the man I have
seen on the fifth floor window?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Were you physically kept from leaving the building when you
got downstairs? Did you try to go out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I wasn't trying to go out of the building because there
wasn't any use of trying to, because at the time we arrived on the first floor, I
heard an officer shout out and say, "No one leave the building."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Have you got any appreciation of the time that elapsed between
your hearing the first shot and the time that you got finally down to the first
floor, after you had been on the fifth floor and the fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I could not give you any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Well, you did not give us any time. Do you have any recollection
now of about how long that was? Was it 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes?
How long did it take from the time that you were looking out that window and
you heard that shot until you did get down to the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Well, I could say approximately 15 minutes, maybe a little
before then, maybe after. I could not say exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know what time it was when you went off and left for
the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I could not give you the exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you know whether or not anybody got out of the building
before the police could get there? Did any of your friends or the people you
were working with, did you hear whether any of them had left the building
before the building was closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I heard Mr. Truly&mdash;he said that&mdash;he mentioned
that&mdash;he said, "Where is Lee?" That is what everybody called him. "Where is
Lee?", he said, and therefore I assume he did not know where Lee was, that he
was out of the building, because everybody else was there. And there was
another colored fellow by the name of Charles Givens. He wasn't in the building
at the time. He was downtown somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Had he been at the building at the time of the shooting&mdash;Givens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. I don't believe he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What did Mr. Truly say about Lee not being there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. The only thing I heard him say is&mdash;I think an officer asked
him, "Is everyone here?" And he said, "Where is Lee?"&mdash;like that, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Truly said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you know the name of the first policeman that accosted you,
who stopped you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Are you familiar with firearms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you ever do any hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I never go hunting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But you have heard shots fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir; I heard my grandfather try a gun out, something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You were not in the army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. No, sir; I have never been in the army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I think that is all I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have one question.</p>

<p>You have referred to three explosions that&mdash;one you thought was a backfire
or a firecracker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was there any difference in the sound of those three explosions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. As far as I remember, there wasn't any difference in the
sound. It was just the time between the sound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. As I heard you testify, you said there was a larger pause between
the first and the second shot than there was between the second and the third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Let me get this clear. Did you see the President crumple after
the shot? Did you see the President hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>. Personally, I did not see him, because I was kind of jumping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Are there any other questions?</p>

<p>Thank you very much, and we appreciate your coming. We will recess at this
time until 2 o'clock this afternoon.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:40 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<h2 id="hlb2"><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF HOWARD LESLIE BRENNAN RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2:05 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The purpose of today's hearing is to have the testimony of Mr.
Brennan here and you gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams has already appeared before us, and Mr. Norman and Mr.
Jarman and also Mr. Truly who will be on the stand later.</p>

<p>You were all witnesses, you were all in the vicinity of the Texas School
Book Depository Building at the time of the assassination of President Kennedy,
and we are going to ask you to give us your knowledge of the facts
such as they come within your knowledge of that event and we will have some
questions that we will wish to ask you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The record will show that Harold Norman, whose nickname is
Hank, is present and Bonnie Ray Williams and James Jarman, whose nickname
is Junior. Mr. Brennan is also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, you testified here this morning, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You are still under oath, Mr. Brennan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe that you testified that you thought you recognized two
of the people that you saw looking out of the fifth floor of the School Book
Depository Building you thought you recognized outside of the building sometime
after the assassination, is that correct?</p>

<p>The two people that you saw, are they any of these three people here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. I believe it is the one on the end and this one here, I
am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By that you would <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I don't know which of those two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's identify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which person do you mean, you mean Mr. Norman sitting opposite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; I believe he was one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you believe it was Mr. Jarman together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Jarman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they with some policeman as they came out of the building
or in custody of some plainclothesman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I don't believe they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw them together come out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I don't believe they were. I don't recall seeing any officer
bring them out or with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you do not believe then that it was Mr. Williams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No; I won't say for sure. I can't tell which of those two it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, you say that you can't, when you say you can't
tell whether it was Mr. Williams or Mr. Norman, did you just see one person
or two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I saw two but I can't identify which one it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could it have been neither one of these persons that you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I think it was one of them. I think it was this boy on the end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You thought it was Mr. Norman. And what about Mr. Jarman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe it was him, too. Am I right or wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I explained that to you this morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you recognize anyone in this room that you saw in the
fifth floor window while you were sitting on the masonry opposite the school book
depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is the two boys that I am speaking of now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That you are speaking of now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You saw these two men in the fifth floor window and you saw
them again on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Coming out of the building down the stairway, coming out on
the street, those were the only two people I could identify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I recall seeing three people with you <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 477 which you testified to this morning was
a recent picture taken of the Texas School Book Depository Building on
March 20. This is you sitting on that concrete wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At first I believe this morning you thought that you saw one
person or two people at the point marked B, and then you later said it was to
the window which would be to <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let's talk about directions. This direction here would be
to the east and this direction here would be to the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be a window to the east or west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I believe it was a window to the east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you saw, you believe you saw two people in this window here
to the east of the window that you first marked B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are not positive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. McCloy, may I have permission to ask this question of this
witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You stated that you saw two employees walking down the steps
of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall whether the two employees that you saw walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
down the steps of the building were the same two employees that you saw on
the window, in the window on the fifth floor at the easterly most end of the
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes; as far as on the fifth floor and at one of these two
windows. The one I circled or this window here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You mean two of the people that <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. At one of the windows I saw two, two of those people, employees
that came down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. But you are not prepared to state which of these three possible
windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. By three, I mean the two windows to the east, plus the one
window which is circled and marked with a B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Nothing makes me think that they were in this window but
I am in question whether it was this window or this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And of the two people that you saw, it is possible you are
saying that one might have been in the window marked B and another might
have been in a window to the east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, are you basing your recollection on what you saw
during the moments that the shots were fired or on what you saw when you
observed these windows prior to the time the motorcade arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. What I saw prior. There was no significance to the fact at
all. In other words, there is a little difference in your memory there on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No questions.</p>

<p>You may be excused, Mr. Brennan.</p>

<p>You two men can also be excused and we will call you in a few moments, Mr.
Jarman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We don't need Mr. Williams at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We don't need you at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. We may want him back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Don't get too far away.</p>

<h2 id="hn">TESTIMONY OF HAROLD NORMAN</h2>

<p>I will ask you if you will please stand and hold up your right hand.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give in this case will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Norman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. 4858 Beulah Place, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. 26. I will be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Clarksville, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you raised in Clarksville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go to school there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I graduated there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In Clarksville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work did you do after you got out of school?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, I remember working in Salina. I did a car washing job
at the McElroy Chevrolet Co., and after I left there I came to Dallas and I
started working at the depository, the School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was about what year did you start working there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. In 1961, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you work there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, I think this coming October would have made 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you work there now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where do you work now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. The Foxboro Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of business is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Engineer instrumentation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work do you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Porter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you leave the Texas School Book Depository for this new
job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I left during the Christmas holidays and the New Year's leave
after we got off for New Year's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In November 1963, this is this last fall, what kind of work were
you doing at the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I was employed as an order filler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the same kind of a job that Lee Oswald had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; just as an employee, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't know him before he came to work there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you get acquainted with him after he was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No. Just knew his name. I mean, you know, he wouldn't talk
to anybody so I <span class="locked">didn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't talk to anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever engage him in conversation at the time he was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir. I just, you know, speak to him, that is all. I wouldn't
engage in conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you the boys that use clipboards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The order fillers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Somebody gives you orders by way of papers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you do after you get an order on a paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. We had a different publisher in the building, and each individual,
he had a publisher that he would take, maybe I would take to a publisher and
the other orders would and we would fill orders and bring them down to the
first floor for them to be checked and shipped out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have to go up and get the books out of cartons, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes. If we didn't have enough down in the bins down on the
first floor we would have to go upstairs, to complete the orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you fill some of your orders from the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many floors did you go to that morning yourself, November 22?
Can you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I believe I went as far as the fifth floor that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is as <span class="locked">far&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever go to the sixth floor that day, that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I can't&mdash;yes, I went up that morning during the time I think
they were laying the floor up there when I went up there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you help them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; I was just up there shooting the breeze.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now what about Lee Oswald. Do you know what publisher he
filled orders for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I knew Scott-Foresman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Scott-Foresman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the publisher assigned to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes. Well, I don't know if he was assigned to him but he filled,
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He filled those orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say then he filled Scott-Foresman book orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know where those books were kept?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. The majority of them were on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you also keep a stock of Scott-Foresman books on the
first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you get to work on the morning of November
the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I got there I would say about 5 minutes of 8 o'clock, 5 minutes
until 8 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You weren't late?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Lee Oswald when you got to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; I don't recall seeing him when I got to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you remember seeing him at any time that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; around about 10 or 10:15, somewhere in the neighborhood
of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Over in the bins by the windows, I mean looking out, you
know, at Elm Street, towards Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. The first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Looking out on Elm through windows, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir. I was looking out the window. He happened to come
by to fill orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say anything to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him at any time after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; no more. I don't recall seeing him any more that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you quit for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I believe I quit around 11:45, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do after you quit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, I went in, washed up and <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you go in and wash up, where did you go to wash up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. In the men's bathroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that bathroom near the domino room or off the domino room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; that is the one off the domino room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is the one near the domino room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; one near the domino room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right next to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you washed up, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, I got my lunch, I ate my lunch in the domino room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you bring your lunch from home that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; I believe I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in what kind of a package did you bring it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. A brown paper sack, paper bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you keep your lunch or leave your lunch from 8 in the
morning until you got it at noon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I left it in the window of the domino room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice any other packages in that window that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I can't say that I noticed any that morning but I know that
some of the fellows did keep their lunches in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice anything, any unusual package in there that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You got your lunch and did you eat your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; I ate my lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you ate your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. In the domino room, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I can't remember who ate in the lunchroom, I mean the
domino room, with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did some other employees eat there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I think there was someone else in there because we usually
played dominoes in there but that particular day we didn't play that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why didn't you play that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, didn't nobody show up there to play like the guys usually
come in to play.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You usually play dominoes during the noon hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Noon hour and the break period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you ate your lunch, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I got with James Jarman, he and I got together on the first
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was James Jarman when you got together with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. He was somewhere in the vicinity of the telephone, I believe.
I am not for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Out near the bins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you call James Jarman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Junior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you and Junior did what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. We went outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went out the front door, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you stand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. We stood on the Elm Street sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes. We didn't go any further than that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time was it that you went out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Oh, I would say, I don't know exactly, around 12 or 12:10,
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was standing with you when you were standing on the
sidewalk, on the Elm Street sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I remember it was Danny Arce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I remember seeing Mr. Truly and Mr. Campbell. They were
standing somewhere behind us, not exactly behind us but they were back of
us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, I believe Billy Lovelady, I think. He was sitting on the
steps there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes. That is about all the employees I remember seeing out
there. There were more people out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stay there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, we stayed there I believe until we got the news that the
motorcade was coming down, let's see, is that Commerce, no Main, because
Commerce&mdash;we went back in the building, James Jarman and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go when you went in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. We got the east elevator. No; the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The west elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. The west elevator. And went to the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The west elevator is the one you use the push button on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; the one you pull the gate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right. It is a push button elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went up to the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you go to the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Usually, one reason was you usually fill orders, I fill quite a
few orders from the fifth floor and I figured I could get, you know, a better
view of the parade or motorcade or whatever it is from the fifth floor because I
was more familiar with that floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you and Junior do after you got off the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. We walked around to the windows facing Elm Street and I can't
recall if any were open or not but I remember we opened some, two or three
windows ourselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did somebody join you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Bonnie Ray, I can't remember if he was there when we got
there or he came later. I know he was with us a period of time later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then did he come down before the President's motorcade
came by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; he was with us before the motorcade came by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you move around any from one window to another before the
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, if I did I didn't move no further than those three windows
that were open in the front there. I didn't move any further than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you some pictures here. This is Commission Exhibit No. 482.
Do you recognize anybody in that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. That is myself and that is Bonnie Ray Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. "Myself" is pointed to as to the window in the extreme southeast
corner of the fifth floor, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Bonnie Ray is in the window next to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you 480. Do you see the window in which you were looking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. That window is where I was looking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you were looking in the extreme southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put over here a red arrow which shows the window from which
you were looking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is 482. Do you see your picture in that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Point out your picture on 482.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. That is myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will point that out with a red arrow on 482. Now were you
standing up or sitting down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I was sitting. I wasn't at all standing up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the time the President's motorcade went by, how were you
sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I believe I wasn't on my knees I don't think, but I was in a
hunched over position somewhat like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Last Friday afternoon, that is March 20, you and Junior Jarman
and Bonnie Ray Williams went up on the fifth floor with me, didn't you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And a photographer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you took a position; did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What position did you take at the window? First of all, what
did I ask you to do? What position did I ask you to take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I believe you told us to take the position that we thought we
were in during the time of the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you recognize this picture, 486? Do you show in the
picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; that is myself there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are sitting there looking out a window. How does that picture
compare with what you remember as to your position when the President's
motorcade went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, I don't think&mdash;I think I was facing the window more
straight during that time, I mean the motorcade, that I am in this position
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That picture shows you looking out the window down the street,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And this is a picture of Bonnie Ray also, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now you saw the President go by, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. About the time that he got past the window where I was, well,
it seems as though he was, I mean you know, brushing his hair. Maybe he
was looking to the public.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Saluting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With which arm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I believe it was his right arm, and I can't remember what the
exact time was but I know I heard a shot, and then after I heard the shot, well,
it seems as though the President, you know, slumped or something, and then
another shot and I believe Jarman or someone told me, he said, "I believe someone
is shooting at the President," and I think I made a statement "It is someone
shooting at the President, and I believe it came from up above us."</p>

<p>Well, I couldn't see at all during the time but I know I heard a third shot
fired, and I could also hear something sounded like the shell hulls hitting the
floor and the ejecting of the rifle, it sounded as though it was to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember whether or not you said anything to the men
then as to whether or not you heard anything from above you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Only I think I remember saying that I thought I could hear
the shell hulls and the ejection of the rifle. I didn't tell I think I hear anybody
moving, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you thought, do you remember you told the men then that
you thought you heard the ejection of the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And shells on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Falling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody say anything as to where they thought the shots
came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, I don't recall of either one of them saying they thought
where it came from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you said you thought it came from where?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Above where we were, above us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any dust or dirt falling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I didn't see any falling but I saw some in Bonnie Ray Williams'
hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody say anything about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I believe Jarman told him that it was in his hair first. Then
I, you know, told him it was and I believe Jarman told him not to brush it out
his hair but I think he did anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After that happened, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, we ran to the farthest window facing the expressway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The farthest window, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here a diagram of this fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I interrupt there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You spoke about seeing the President sort of slump over after
the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; I believe the first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you see the President hit on any subsequent shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; I don't recall seeing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is a diagram of the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. The sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of the fifth floor rather, which is Commission's 487, and this is the
southeast corner window. To what window did you and your two friends run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. This is the south. This is the window we were in. We came to
this last, I believe it is the next to the last or the last window on this end
here, right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the other day when you were up on the fifth floor with a
photographer, you ran to that window, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, we ran to the window, we thought it was the window we
ran to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you opened that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And had your picture taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is 485. Is that the window as you remembered it that you
ran to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I can't say it was that particular window that day but it was
between these two windows here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One of the two windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is marked Y here on 487, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you run down to that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, it seems as though everyone else was running towards
the railroad tracks, and we ran over there. Curious to see why everybody was
running that way for. I thought <span class="locked">maybe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody say anything about going up to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I don't remember anyone saying about going up to the sixth
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then did you leave that window that you have marked Y on 487?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went to what window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. To the west window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Look on the diagram and tell me what window you went to, as you
remember it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. It was between this point here, these two right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is marked Z?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you went to that window?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I don't remember if we raised the window or not but I
remember looking out the window that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is a picture 489 taken last Friday when you were with me
on that floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you show in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the window you looked out of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; I believe that is the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you look at when you looked out that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. We saw the policeman, and I guess they were detectives, they
were searching the empty cars over there. I remember seeing some guy on
top of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On top of the cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes. They were going through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw police officers searching cars over on the railroad tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long did you stay at that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I don't remember, but it wasn't very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. We ran down to the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As you were at the fifth floor, looking west as shown in Exhibit
No. 489, were you able to see the stairwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Because there is a row of bins there that prevents you standing
in a position that I was in to keep you from seeing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is 492. Does that show the row of bins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; the row of bins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They block off the stairwell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember that we tried an experiment when you were
there by putting you three men in line and then taking a picture to see if we
could see any one of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is a picture 491. That is your picture, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. In the middle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who is that on the end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Which end? Oh, this is Bonnie Ray Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is this one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. James Jarman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then a picture, do you remember another picture was taken,
492?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; I remember that picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you see anyone in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I see one person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you make him out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes. I recognize him as James Jarman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Jarman, the one on the end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now did you see any police officer come up on that floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or did you see Mr. Truly come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or did you hear any elevator operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Going up or down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir; I don't recall anyone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you were brought to the first floor or when you came to the
first floor how did you go down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. We came down the stairway. I remember we came down the
stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got to the first floor did someone talk to you, police
officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I don't remember a police officer talking to me as soon as we
got down there. I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anyone talk to you later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I guess they were Secret Service men. But I know they talked
to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they take you over to the police station later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; they didn't carry me to the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you leave the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Oh, I would say somewhere around 2 o'clock, somewhere in
the vicinity of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did you leave with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Mr. James Jarman. I can't remember who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the time that you went down on the first door until you
left the building to go home did you leave the building at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. They kept us on the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did make a statement later to the Secret Service, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here a document 493, which is a copy of a statement made
by this witness, which I now mark 493.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 493, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The document that I have here shows the date 4th of December 1963.
Do you remember having made a statement to Mr. Carter, Special Agent of
the Secret Service, on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I can't remember the exact date but I believe I remember
Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I want to call your attention to one part of the statement and I
will ask you if you told him that:</p>

<p>"Just after the President passed by, I heard a shot and several seconds
later I heard two more shots. I knew that the shots had come from directly
above me, and I could hear the expended cartridges fall to the floor. I could
also hear the bolt action of the rifle. I also saw some dust fall from the
ceiling of the fifth floor and I felt sure that whoever had fired the shots was
directly above me."</p>

<p>Did you make that statement to the Secret Service man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I don't remember making a statement that I knew the shots
came from directly above us. I didn't make that statement. And I don't
remember saying I heard several seconds later. I merely told him that I
heard three shots because I didn't have any idea what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. Did you tell them that you heard the bolt action of the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that you heard the expended cartridges fall to the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; I heard them making a sound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to offer this into evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to, heretofore identified as Commission Exhibit
No. 493 for identification, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You used the expression you heard the ejection. This refers
to the bolt action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Those are the same things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; that is what I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is what you meant by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What language did you use when you talked to the Secret Service
man, do you know? Did you say you heard the ejection or that you heard
the bolt action? Which did you use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I probably said the ejection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is what you think you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same thing you said here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember Friday that we conducted an experiment to
see whether or not you could hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you put yourself in order to conduct the experiment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. In the same window. I may not have been in the same position
but I was in the same window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that window was open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the window, was the window on the sixth floor also open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; they told me it was open. I didn't see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And a Secret Service man went upstairs with a rifle, didn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, I heard the same sound, the sound similar. I heard
three something that he dropped on the floor and then I could hear the rifle
or whatever he had up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You could hear the rifle, the sound of an ejection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear the sound of the bolt going back and forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; I sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You could hear it clearly, could you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now there has been a new floor put in on the sixth floor, hasn't
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The day that you were there on November 22, what was the condition
of the ceiling and the floor of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I would say that you could see daylight through there because
during the times they put the plywood down you can see the plywood, some
portion of the plywood, so I would say you could see a little daylight during
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you were there Friday afternoon, did you look up at the
ceiling from where you were sitting at the southeast window on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What could you see on the ceiling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. There was one place I could see the plywood and then another
place you could still see a little daylight, I mean peering through the crack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the joint where the upper floor or the floor of the
sixth and ceiling of the fifth floor comes against the wall. Could you see
daylight through there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Against the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; in one place you could see a small amount of daylight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now the day of the experiment last Friday when you heard the
cartridges eject, the bolt action and the cartridges <span class="locked">ejecting&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any noise outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. There was a train and there were trucks and cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there more noise or less noise on the day you conducted the
experiment last Friday, March 20, than on November 22, at 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. It was more noise last Friday than it was November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any train going by on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any trucks going by on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. How did you get your job at the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Well, as I remember the time that I told you before I used to
live in Salina and washing cars at the Chevrolet company I had a friend that
lived in Dallas and he was working down there, and he told me that he thought
that I could get a job down there, and that is how I got familiar with the
place. I did go by there and Mr. Truly gave me a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Were you getting better pay there than you had at your former
job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. At the Chevrolet company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; I was getting better pay there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you have any rough recollection of the amount of time
that passed between the time you heard the first shot and when you ran down
to the west end of the building and looked out the window there and the time
when you left the fifth floor and finally came down to the first floor where the
police officers were? Can you give me a general estimate of about how
much time that took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. To come down from the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes. From the time you first heard the shot and saw what
was going on in the motorcade and then ran down toward the western end of
the building and then as I understand your testimony, you left there and went
down to the&mdash;did you go down to the fourth floor first or did you go all the
way down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I believe we went all the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Until you got down to the first floor, how much would you say
was the entire length of that time, from the first shot until you got down on
the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Oh, I would say somewhere between 10 or 15 minutes, somewhere
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I don't think I have any other questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have one question.</p>

<p>On the 26th of November, an FBI agent named Kreutzer advises us in a
report that he talked to you. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes; I remember talking to him. I don't know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He reports that you told him that you heard a shot and that
you stuck your head from the window and looked upward toward the roof but
could see nothing because small particles of dirt were falling from above
you. Did you tell him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I don't recall telling him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever put your head out the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir; I don't remember ever putting my head out the
window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he reports that you stated that two additional shots were
fired after you pulled your head back in from the window. Do you remember
telling him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Have you ever had any difficulty with the law? Have you ever
been convicted of a crime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. At the time after you heard the shots, did you have any thought
that you might run upstairs and see if anybody was up there where the shots
were coming from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you feel that it might be dangerous to go upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You testified that you had not seen Oswald except this one
occasion in the morning. Did you hear any of your friends or coworkers say
whether they had seen Oswald on that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Not until <span class="locked">after&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. After the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; that is the only time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Did you see Brennan down there when you came downstairs?
Did you come out the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; I came out the front door and I remember seeing Mr.
Brennan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how long after the shooting was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. It wasn't very long because&mdash;I can't remember the time but
it wasn't too long a period of time, and I remember seeing him because he had
on a steel helmet, a little steel helmet.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was he standing with another man and they called
you over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I don't know if he was exactly standing with another man,
but it was several people standing around there, and I remember him talking
and I believe I remember him saying that he saw us when we first went
up to the fifth floor window, he saw us then. I believe I heard him say that,
but otherwise I don't know if he was standing by. There was quite a few
people standing around there.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You were stopped and Mr. Brennan made these
comments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir; I remember.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On the front entrance steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Of the Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Then did you go out of the building, away from the building
or come back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. No, sir; we had to go back inside.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You had to go back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you went out in front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then came back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you had gone to the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did law enforcement officers make you go back or did
you do it on your own initiative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I remember, I don't know if this is the only time or not, but I
remember the law enforcement saying not to let anybody leave from the building
and I can't remember if that is the time we went back in the building or before
or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did you go out with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. I know James Jarman and I went out. I can't remember.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask did we get into the testimony enough of his
background and biography?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Clear from where he was born, through high school and all his
jobs through high school.</p>

<p>He is 26 years old, married, and never been in any trouble in his life. I think
that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Thank you, Mr. Norman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much for coming.</p>

<p>Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<h2 id="jj">TESTIMONY OF JAMES JARMAN, JR.</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Chief Justice Warren, this is Mr. Jarman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. How do you do. Glad to see you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Congressman <span class="locked">Ford&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Would you hold up your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you give in this case will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The statement has been read to you as to the purpose of your
examination before the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Hasn't it, Mr. Jarman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. State your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. James Jarman, Junior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do they call you, Junior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I started in 1956. I worked from August up until November,
and I was laid off until December the same year and I started back again and
I worked up until 1958 I believe, 1958 or 1959, and I quit there and went to
Parkland Hospital. From there I went back to the Depository. And I got
laid off again and I went to Bakers Hotel, and I think it was in 1961 I went
back to the Depository and I have been there ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was your job at the Depository in November of 1963, last
fall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Checker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What does a checker do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He checks various orders, books and things that go out to
different schools.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do the order fillers bring the books down to where you have
<span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On a table. You have a table?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I have a table with a scale and I weigh these books up and
put the upholstery on them and put them on a little conveyor and the wrappers
wrap them or pack them, whichever one it may be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Only as a coworker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to him while he was working there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I have had him to correct orders at various times. That is
about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to him about politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Religion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Not until that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Not until that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald have any friends there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have any close friend that he would eat lunch with every
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice whether Oswald brought his lunch most of the time
or bought his lunch most of the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Most of the time he brought his lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Most of the time he brought his lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him buy his lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, occasionally. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I don't understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I mean sometimes he would go out of the building. One time
I know in particular that he went out, but he didn't buy any lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a catering service that comes by the building every morning
at 10 o'clock, isn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him buy his lunch from this catering service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I think once or twice he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him when he was eating his lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Sometimes in the, as we called it, domino room, and again over
by the coffee table where they make coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. That is the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now on November 22, what time did you get to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. About 5 minutes after 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Oswald there when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you see him the first time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, he was on the first floor filling orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you bring your lunch that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do about lunch that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I got a sandwich off the carrying truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. It was about 10 or a little after 10, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you put it, keep it until lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. In the domino room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where in the domino room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, they have two little windows, they have two sets of windows
in there and I put it in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to Oswald that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I had him to correct an order. I don't know exactly what time
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oh, approximately. Nine, ten?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. It was around, it was between eight and nine, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Between 8 and 9?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Between 5 minutes after 8 and 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had him correct an order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to him again that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir. I talked to him again later on that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. It was between 9:30 and 10 o'clock, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you talked to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. In between two rows of bins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. On the first floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was said by him and by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, he was standing up in the window and I went to the window
also, and he asked me what were the people gathering around on the corner
for, and I told him that the President was supposed to pass that morning, and
he asked me did I know which way he was coming, and I told him, yes; he
probably come down Main and turn on Houston and then back again on Elm.</p>

<p>Then he said, "Oh, I see," and that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you quit for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. It was right about 5 minutes to 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you quit for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Went in the rest room and washed up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Went and got my sandwich and went up in the lounge and got
me a soda pop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is the lounge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. On the second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the second floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then where did you go after you got your soda pop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Came back and went down to the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Where Oswald and I was talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Between those two rows of bins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where Oswald and you had been talking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I was eating part of my sandwich there, and then I came back
out and as I was walking across the floor I ate the rest of it going toward the
domino room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you ate the rest of it when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Walking around on the first floor there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you sit down at the window when you ate part of your sandwich?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No; I was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you have the pop in your hand, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes; I had a sandwich in one hand and pop in the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you wandered around, you mean on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. On the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you with anybody when you were at the window? Did you
talk to anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you with anybody when you were walking around finishing
your sandwich?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No; I wasn't. I was trying to get through so I could get out
on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After his arrest, he stated to a police officer that he had had lunch
with you. Did you have lunch with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you finished your sandwich and your bottle of pop, what
did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I throwed the paper that I had the sandwich in in the box over
close to the telephone and I took the pop bottle and put it in the case over by
the Dr. Pepper machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Then I went out in front of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Harold Norman, Bonnie Ray, and Danny Arce and myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say Bonnie Ray Williams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Bonnie Ray Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember him going with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No; I am sorry. Excuse me, but it was Harold Norman and
myself and Daniel Arce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Billy Lovelady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I didn't go out with them. They came out later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Billy Lovelady out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Standing on the stairway as you go out the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you stand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I was standing over to the right in front of the building going
toward the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you on the sidewalk or curb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. On the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The sidewalk in front of the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stand there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, until about 12:20, between 12:20 and 12:25.</p>

you in the Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Harold Norman and Charles Givens and Daniel Arce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Mr. Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He wasn't standing close to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was he with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He was with the Vice President of the company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. O. V. Campbell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were they standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. They were standing at the corner of the building in front of
the mail boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You left there, didn't you, and went some place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Harold Norman and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. We went around to the back of the building up to the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you went around. You mean you went around the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't go through and cross the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir; there was too many people standing on the stairway
there, so we decided to go around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went in the back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be the north entrance to the building, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take an elevator or the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. We took the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. The west side elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the one you use a punch button on, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. To the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you go to the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. We just decided to go to the fifth floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any reason why you should go to the fifth floor any more
than the fourth or the sixth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know who made the suggestion you go to the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, I don't know if it was myself or Hank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got there was there anybody on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you got to the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. We got out the elevator and pulled the gate down. That was
in case somebody wanted to use it. Then we went to the front of the building,
which is on the south side, and raised the windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which windows did you raise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, Harold raised the first window to the east side of the
building, and I went to the second rear windows and raised, counting the
windows, it would be the fourth one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It would be the fourth window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did somebody join you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir; a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who joined you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Bonnie Ray Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did he stand or sit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He took the window next to Harold Norman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a picture which is 480, a picture of the Texas School
Book Depository Building. Can you show me the window before which you were
standing and out of which you were looking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. This window here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is marked W on this picture. Where was Harold Norman, the
window out of which Harold Norman was looking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He was first right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the one marked with a red arrow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was Bonnie Ray Williams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Bonnie Ray Williams was in this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Next to the window of Norman, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What exhibit is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is 480. This is 482. You recognize those two pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Harold Norman and Bonnie Ray Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now the other day you went up to the fifth floor of the Texas State
School Book Depository with me and a photographer, and had your picture taken,
did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did I ask you to do before the picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. To try to get in the same position that we were the day the assassination
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir. We tried to the best of our knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have a picture here I would like to have marked as Commission
Exhibit 494.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It is so marked.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 494 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that your picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Taken last Friday afternoon, March 20th, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now does it or does it not show your position at about the time,
as you were watching the President's motorcade go by?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir; that is the position I had as it was going by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are on your knees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show this to each member of the Commission. This is a new
exhibit. 485, you recognize that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What does it show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. It shows that I was on my knees as the motorcade was passing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And shows the other two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. As the motorcade was passing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It shows their position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. At the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the time the motorcade was passing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This has been introduced into evidence. I don't believe you have
seen that, Congressman.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is yourself here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The one closest to an individual looking at the photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After the motorcade passed, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. After the motorcade turned, going west on Elm, then there
was a loud shot, or backfire, as I thought it was then&mdash;I thought it was a
backfire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You thought it was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. A backfire or an officer giving a salute to the President. And
then at that time I didn't, you know, think too much about it. And then the
second shot was fired, and that is when the people started falling on the ground
and the motorcade car jumped forward, and then the third shot was fired right
behind the second one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you still on your knees looking up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, after the third shot was fired, I think I got up and I ran
over to Harold Norman and Bonnie Ray Williams, and told them, I said, I told
them that it wasn't a backfire or anything, that somebody was shooting at the
President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then did they say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Hank said, Harold Norman, rather, said that he thought the
shots had came from above us, and I noticed that Bonnie Ray had a few debris
in his head. It was sort of white stuff, or something, and I told him not to
brush it out, but he did anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had some white what, like plaster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Like some come off a brick or plaster or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Norman say anything else that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He said that he was sure that the shot came from inside the
building because he had been used to guns and all that, and he said it didn't
sound like it was too far off anyway. And so we ran down to the west side
of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Norman say anything about hearing cartridges or ejection or
anything like that, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. That was after we got down to the west side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you got down where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. To the west side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Down the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now you ran down to the west side of the building, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when you were up there you showed me the window to which
you ran, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The picture was taken of you at that place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you ran down there was the window open or closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. It was closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who opened it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do after you opened the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I leaned out and the officers and various people was running
across the tracks, toward the tracks over there where they had the passenger
trains, and all, boxcars and things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you 488. What does that show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. That shows me leaning out the window and Bonnie Ray and
Harold Norman was over to the side of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. The window on the west side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the one to which you ran after you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you looked out that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to run to that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, I wanted to see what was going on mostly, because that
was after the motorcade car had took off, and I thought they had stopped under
the underpass, but they hadn't. So they went on around the bend, and after
I couldn't see from there I ran to another, the second window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That second one you ran to, you pointed that out to me last Friday,
did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the picture was taken of that, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that window is on which side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. On the west side of the building also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you 489. Is that a picture of the west window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you see when you looked out that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. When I looked out that window, I saw the policemen and the
secret agents, the FBI men, searching the boxcar yard and the passenger train
and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you heard Harold Norman say something
that he had heard cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. All that took place right here in this corner after we had went
to this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This corner. What corner do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. In the corner of the building right after we had looked out
this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right here on the west side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the west side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And would that be the window that is shown in 488, or the window
that is shown in 489?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. It was between the two windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Between the two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. As we was going to this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear him say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He said it was something sounded like cartridges hitting the
floor, and he could hear the action of the rifle, I mean the bolt, as it were
pulled back, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you heard anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir; I hadn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you heard any person running upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or any steps upstairs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any noise at all up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here a diagram which is 487. This is the southeast corner
of the building on this diagram. Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is the Elm Street side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you point out the window to which you three boys ran when
you looked out, you opened the window and looked out towards <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. This one here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The one marked Y on this diagram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. This one right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That one marked Y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is the window to which you went afterwards to look out
when you saw the police and other agents searching boxcars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I went to the second window from the south side of the building
on the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the one marked Z?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that time could you see the stairwell when you stood there
at Z?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir; I couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Because there is a row of bins there with books in them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They block your view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did we conduct an experiment there to see how much you
could see from Z?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a picture, 491. Do you remember standing in line
near the stairwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is you on the end, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the end, the farthest from the stairwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And we took a picture, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of that area. Does that show the bins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. That shows the bins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I am now referring to 492.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now was there any part of the stairwell that you could see when
you were along this west wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you see the elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I imagine if I had looked over, but I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember any of the elevators coming up or down as you
were standing there at the west window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Looking toward the railroad track?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember seeing Mr. Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or did you see a motorcycle officer come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or did you hear the elevator go up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you men do after you looked out the window toward
the railroad tracks from the west window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, after Norman had made his statement that he had heard
the cartridges hit the floor and this bolt action, I told him we'd better get
the hell from up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody suggest you go up to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Down. We ran to the elevator first, but the elevator had gone
down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Then we ran to the stairway and ran downstairs, and we
paused a few minutes on four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which elevator did you run to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. To the elevator on the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the west. That wasn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went downstairs, what did you see on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. When we got downstairs on the first floor, I think the first
one I seen was Eddie Piper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Eddie Piper works there, does he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who else did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. And I ran into Roy Edward Lewis, which is also another
employee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody else there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir. I ran, then we ran to the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You ran to the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir; and out on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Harold Norman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You and Harold went out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see a fellow named Brennan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you see him first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He was talking to a police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How was he dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He was dressed in construction clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anything else, any other way to describe him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, he had on a silverlike helmet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Hard-hat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stay out there very long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Just a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. We heard him talking to this officer about that he had heard
these shots and he had seen the barrel of the gun sticking out the window,
and he said that the shots came from inside the building, and I told the officer
that I believed that they came from inside the building also, and then he
rushed us back inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The officer did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you know this fellow was Brennan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, at that time I didn't know him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you learned that since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who told you that the man in the hard-hat was Brennan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, they have had him down there at the building a couple
of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you taken to the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make a statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. That Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay in the building, the Texas School Book
Depository Building that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I'd say it was somewhere between two and two-thirty when they
turned us loose and told us to go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you were there did you notice whether any of the employees
were missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you notice, and who was missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. When we started to line up to show our identification, quite a
few of us asked where was Lee. That is what we called him, and he wasn't
anywhere around. We started asking each other, have you seen Lee Oswald,
and they said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anybody else missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Charles Douglas Givens, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Charles Givens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I can't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Had Givens been in the Depository that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir; he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. He had been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Givens come back later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He didn't come back to the building until they picked him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He did come back to the building before you left, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was not there when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you were on the fifth floor, did you pay any attention to
whether or not there was noise above you, before the shots were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, if there was noise up there&mdash;let's put it this way.
If there had been any noise up there, you didn't notice it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now after the shooting, did you hear any noise from upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you listen for any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long was it before you ran down to the west end, from the
time of the shots until you ran down to the west end, about how much time do
you think it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. After the third shot was fired I would say it was about a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You have had military experience, haven't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And you can recognize rifle shots when you hear them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But you didn't hear, you didn't catch the sound of the bolt
moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you see the President actually hit by the bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir. I couldn't say that I saw him actually hit, but after
the second shot, I presumed that he was, because I had my eye on his car from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the time it came down Houston until the time it started toward the freeway
underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You saw him crumple, you saw him fall, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I saw him lean his head.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You actually saw the car lurch forward, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is a distinct impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you had followed it as it turned from Main on to
Houston and followed it as it turned from Houston on to Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Had your eye on the car all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where did you think the sound of the first shot came
from? Do you have a distinct impression of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, it sounded, I thought at first it had came from below.
That is what I thought.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As you looked out the window and you were looking
at the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you have a distinct impression as to whether the
sound came from your left or from your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I am sure it came from the left.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But your first reaction, that is was from below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When the second shot came, do you have any different
recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Well, they all sounded just about the same.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You distinctly recall three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And at what point did you get up from where you were
on your knees in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. When the motorcar picked up speed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this after what you thought was the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. The third shot; yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. McCloy said you had been in the army 8 years,
two 4-year hitches. Was there any doubt in your mind that this was a gunshot,
either one of the three?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Not after the second shot. I didn't have any doubt in my mind
then.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did you first learn of the President's motorcade
route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. That morning.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Friday morning, November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How did you find out about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. The foreman of the employees on the first floor.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. William Shelley was standing up talking to Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To Mrs. Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Miss Lee, or Mrs. Lee, I think, and he was discussing to her
about the President coming, asked her was she going to stand out there and
see him pass.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. About what time Friday morning was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I imagine it would be about&mdash;I think it was between 8:30 and
9:00. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You hadn't read about it in the papers the night before
or that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did you have this conversation with Lee Oswald,
where he asked you&mdash;you told him that the motorcade was coming by the School
Book Depository Building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. It was some time that morning, between 9:30 and 10:30.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This was after you heard Mr. Shelley and Miss or
Mrs. Lee talk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Discuss it&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did Oswald ask you, or did you initiate the conversation
and tell Oswald of the route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He asked me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What was his reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. After I had told him the route that the President probably would
take, he just said, "Oh, I see" and went back to filling orders.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You testified earlier that you were standing on the steps
or in front of the School Depository Building prior to the President's motorcade
coming by the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir. I was standing on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But in front of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. In front of the building.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Then you said you went around the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What route did you take? Did you go down Elm or
did you go down Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I went to the corner of the building facing Elm, and turned
going north on Houston.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you turn around and&mdash;here is the main entrance
on Elm Street. And you were standing out on the sidewalk more or less where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In which direction did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. This way.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You went by the front to the corner of Houston and
Elm, and then down Houston towards the loading dock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And where did you get on the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. We walked around to the back entrance and went through this
door here, and this elevator here was up on six, I believe. And we walked around
the elevator and took the west elevator up.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How could you tell this elevator was at six?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Because after we got around to the other side we looked up.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You could see it was on six?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. That was about 12:25 or 12:28.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You got off the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. As you rode the elevator, you noticed the other one was
on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you ever been in any trouble with the police or
did you ever have any disciplinary troubles in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How was Oswald dressed that morning when you saw him at
work? Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. I don't exactly recall how he was dressed. I think he had on
some dress pants. But I didn't notice the color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of pants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Some kind of these slacks you wear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of a shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Ivy leagues, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of a shirt, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. He never hardly worked in a shirt. He worked in a T-shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember if he had a T-shirt on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes; he had on a T-shirt that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you see at any time Oswald that morning with a bundle or
package of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. When did you first come to the conclusion that any of the
shots came from up above you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. After we had ran down to this last window on the west side of
the building, and we was discussing it. And then after I got to thinking about
all the debris on Bonnie Ray's head, and I thought about that, also. And so I
told Hank, I say, "That shot probably did come from upstairs, up over us,"
and Hank said, "I know it did, because I could hear the action of the bolt, and
I could hear the cartridges drop on the floor."</p>

<p>And I told him there we better get the hell from up here.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Now, tell me, when you went downstairs&mdash;when you were
downstairs and went out the first time, that is, just before you met Brennan,
did anyone stop you as you went out the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You could have gone right away if you wanted to, could you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And then you happened to run across Brennan, and had this
conversation with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. No. He ran up to the police officer and was telling him about
the man sticking a gun out the window. And I heard him telling the officer
that.</p>

<p>And I told him that I thought the shots came from inside, too.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Are you a married man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Do you have a family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. Yes, sir; three children.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think that is all.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for coming and helping us out. We appreciate it very
much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jarman</span>. We are glad to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Chairman, we would like to recall Mr. Brennan.</p>

<h2 id="hlb3">TESTIMONY OF HOWARD LESLIE BRENNAN RESUMED</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Brennan, you are the same Howard Leslie Brennan who testifled
this morning here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know a George Murray, of the National Broadcasting Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever worked for the Union Terminal <span class="locked">Co.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You are still under oath, you realize.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever worked for the Union Terminal Co. in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever state to anyone that you heard shots from opposite
the Texas School Book Depository and saw smoke and paper wadding come
out of boxes on a slope below the railroad trestle at the time of the assassination?
Did you ever say that or that, in substance, to anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. Is there another Howard Brennan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, sir; we don't know. We wanted to know whether or not
you ever made this statement to anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Brennan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brennan</span>. I would like to ask a question off the record.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<h2 id="rst">TESTIMONY OF ROY SANSOM TRULY</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Next we will call Mr. Truly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Will you raise your right hand, and stand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give in this case will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I would like to state, Mr. Truly, what the purpose of this
hearing is.</p>

<p>This is to hear the testimony of several witnesses, or people close to the
event of the assassination of the President, to get as much knowledge as we
can of the facts concerning that event, which largely centers around the School
Book Depository and the people in it, on the afternoon of November 22d.</p>

<p>Will you state for the record your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Roy Sansom Truly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Truly, where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I live at 4932 Jade Drive, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you originally from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No. I have been in Dallas since 1925.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you born, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Hubbard, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what was your birth date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. August 29, 1907.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Truly, where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I finished high school at Hubbard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. In Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what did you do after you finished high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, I came to Dallas in the fall of that year and I have been
there ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For whom did you become employed when you came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I believe&mdash;my father ran a cafe here in Dallas, and I worked
with him a short while. And then in the fall of 1925, I went to work for Higginbotham,
Bailey, Logan Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What business is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is wholesale drygoods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And how long did you work with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I believe a little less than a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I went to work for National Casket Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And about how long did you work for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I couldn't be certain. Several years&mdash;maybe 3 or 4 or 5 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And in what capacity did you work for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, I worked in the cloth room, learning the trade of putting
in the drapery and things in the caskets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And from there, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I worked a short time at the Dallas Coffin Co., several months.
It wasn't very long. And I left there and during the depression I worked
for several things. I drove a laundry truck off and on for a couple of years.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I believe I even worked for the WPA back there in those days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>And after the depression, where did you start working then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I went to work for the Texas School Book Depository in July 1934.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And have you been employed by the Texas School Book Depository
since that date, since July 1934?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what capacity have you worked for that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. First, when I first went to work for this company, I had charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the miscellaneous order department, which is actually a one-man operation. I
filled orders for books other than state-adopted textbooks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I worked on through that time until the present time.</p>

<p>During the war I worked in the North American plant at Arlington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is the North American Aviation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. North American Aviation plant at Arlington, for around 14 months,
at night. But I continued to hold my job.</p>

<p>Well, I would go down to work 2, 3, 4 hours a day. Shortly after that, I took
charge of all the shipping.</p>

<p>Well, I have been superintendent of the operation since some time in the late
1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been superintendent of the Texas School Book Depository.
And do you have any other positions with the company at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am a director&mdash;I am a member of the board of directors of the
Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that a State organization or a private company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It is a private corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Truly, when did you first hear of the name of Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I heard the name on or about October 15th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And from whom did you hear the name? Could you just relate to
the Commission the circumstances, if you would, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I received a phone call from a lady in Irving who said her name
was Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>What did Mrs. Paine say, and what did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. She said, "Mr. Truly"&mdash;words to this effect&mdash;you understand&mdash;"Mr.
Truly, you don't know who I am but I have a neighbor whose brother works
for you. I don't know what his name is. But he tells his sister that you are
very busy. And I am just wondering if you can use another man," or words
to that effect.</p>

<p>And I told Mrs.&mdash;she said, "I have a fine young man living here with his wife
and baby, and his wife is expecting a baby&mdash;another baby, in a few days, and
he needs work desperately."</p>

<p>Now, this is not absolutely&mdash;this is as near as I can remember the conversation
over the telephone.</p>

<p>And I told Mrs. Paine that&mdash;to send him down, and I would talk to him&mdash;that
I didn't have anything in mind for him of a permanent nature, but if he was
suited, we could possibly use him for a brief time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything else from that conversation that you remember
at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No. I believe that was the first and the last time that I talked
to Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>In fact, I could not remember her name afterwards until I saw her name in
print, and then it popped into my mind that this was the lady who called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Anything else on&mdash;what was this&mdash;October 15th&mdash;about Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir; I am sure it was on October 15th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can remember about Lee Harvey Oswald on
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. She told me she would tell him to come down and see me.</p>

<p>So he came in, introduced himself to me, and I took him in my office and
interviewed him. He seemed to be quiet and well mannered.</p>

<p>I gave him an application to fill out, which he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he fill it out in front of you, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; he did. And he told me&mdash;I asked him about experience that
he had had, or where he had worked, and he said he had just served his term
in the Marine Corps and had received an honorable discharge, and he listed some
things of an office nature that he had learned to do in the Marines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
I questioned him about any past activities. I asked him if he had ever had
any trouble with the police, and he said, no. So thinking that he was just out
of the Marines, I didn't check any further back. I didn't have anything of a
permanent nature in mind for him. He looked like a nice young fellow to me&mdash;he
was quiet and well mannered. He used the word "sir", you know, which a lot
of them don't do at this time.</p>

<p>So I told him if he would come to work on the morning of the 16th, it
was the beginning of a new pay period. So he filled out his withholding
slip, with the exception of the number of dependents.</p>

<p>He asked me if I would hold that for 3 or 4 days, that he is expecting a baby
momentarily.</p>

<p>So some 4 days or so later&mdash;I don't remember the exact day&mdash;he told me
that he had this new baby, and he wanted to add one dependent.</p>

<p>He finished filling it out. And I sent it up to Mr. Campbell who makes out the
payroll for the company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, on October 15th you saw him fill out the application form
for employment in his own writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You also saw him fill out the withholding slip, except for the number
of exemptions, in his own writing, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any other conversation that you can remember from your meeting
on October 15th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, he told me that he needed a job. He said he had a wife
and child to support. And he also repeated that he was expecting a child
in a few days.</p>

<p>And I told Lee Oswald that I had some work, that if he could fit in, of a temporary
nature, we could put him on. But I didn't have anything in mind of
a permanent job at that time, because I didn't have any openings for a permanent
person. And he said he would be glad to have any type of work I would
give him, because he did need&mdash;and he stressed he really needed a job to support
his family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else from that conversation on October 15th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Nothing that I can recall, except that he seemed to be grateful
that I was giving him the chance of a little extra work, if you want to call
it that.</p>

<p>He left, and I didn't see him any more until the morning of the 16th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were his hours of work to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. His hours were from 8 in the morning until 4:45 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>His lunch period was from 12 to 12:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have a time clock there that they punch or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The next morning, do you know whether or not he came to
work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He came to work the next morning. I told him what his duties
were to be&mdash;would be filling book orders. And I told Mr. Shelley, who is on that
floor and has charge of the miscellaneous department.</p>

<p>Now, this particular thing as to whether I called a boy or Mr. Shelley did&mdash;anyway,
we put Lee Oswald with another worker who was experienced in filling
orders. This boy showed him the location of the various publishers' stock.
He worked with him, it seems to me, like only an hour or two, and then he started
filling orders by himself. And from then on he worked alone.</p>

<p>He would occasionally ask the other boys where certain stock items were
when he couldn't find them. But he was filling small parcel post and a few
freight orders for the various schools&mdash;as they would come down from the
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, could you describe how his work progressed as he was
working with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, he seemed to catch on and learn the location of the stock.
We have several thousand titles of books in our warehouse. But he was filling
mostly one or two publishers' orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What publishers were those?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The main publisher was Scott, Foresman and Co.</p>

<p>Now, they have quite a lot of small orders, all through the year. They are
one of our biggest publishers. So it kept him busy filling mostly their orders,
plus some of the smaller publishers. Possibly he filled some of Gregg Publishing
Co. and others. But when he would run out of Scott, Foresman orders,
he would pick up other orders that might have had several publishers' books
on the same order.</p>

<p>Incidentally, not only Scott, Foresman orders were billed separately. There
would be other publishers' orders on the same invoice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, perhaps you might explain to the Commission just what
exactly the nature of your business is, and how an employee would go about
filling orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We are agents for a number of publishers. We furnish offices
for those who desire them in Texas. And our business is shipping, inventorying,
collecting, doing all the bookkeeping work for the various publishers'
books.</p>

<p>Now, we have&mdash;most of the publishers' stock is lined up alphabetically by
titles or by stock numbers or code numbers, whichever determines that.</p>

<p>And the location of the books&mdash;each publisher's books are to themselves.
They are not mixed in with several other publishers on the various floors.</p>

<p>On the first floor we have bin stock, shelf stock, we fill a lot of small orders
from.</p>

<p>And then in the basement the same.</p>

<p>The fifth and the sixth floor, and part of the seventh floor is overflow stock.
It is reserve stock.</p>

<p>But the boys have to go to those floors all during the day to pick up stock
and bring it to the first floor in order to process and complete the orders for
the checker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What would reserve stock mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Actually it is not reserve stock&mdash;it is not surplus either. It is
part of our stock. But we can carry a limited amount only on the first floor
where we do our shipping. So they may get an order for a hundred copies
of a certain book and there may only be 10 or 15 or 20 on the shelf on the first
floor. They will have to go upstairs and get a carton or two. And they replenish
the first floor stock from that.</p>

<p>And many of our freight orders are filled entirely from our reserve stock.
And they bring them to the first floor. All orders reach the first floor, where
they are checked and processed and packed and shipped from that floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where, generally, are Scott, Foresman books kept?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. On the first floor and the sixth floor. We have a large quantity
of their books on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And this is the area where Lee Harvey Oswald worked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That publisher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That publisher. He had occasion to go to the sixth floor quite
a number of times every day, each day, after books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when an order would come in, how would it get to the individual
employee, so the employee would go out and pick out the books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The orders came into our office and were processed by our girls,
priced and billed by the bill clerks, and then were sent down a little chute to
the first floor, a little dumbwaiter, regardless of publisher.</p>

<p>The boys would take them off of this dumbwaiter and carry them over on
to a little table near the checker stand.</p>

<p>Various ones would sort out the publishers&mdash;sort out the orders by publishers.</p>

<p>Scott Foresman could be here, there would be a stock of Gregg and Southwestern
over here, we have a number of small publishers, maybe we would
group them altogether. And the boys usually know which particular orders
they are supposed to fill from, because they know the books, they can tell.</p>

<p>On each order it says, "SF" for Scott, Foresman on each invoice and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do they just pick up the piece of paper for the order and carry
them around with them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right. Most of them use a clipboard. They may have
several orders at a time on the clipboard. That saves them going back to the
table continually for one order. These orders amount from anything to $3 or
$4 to $300 or $400, on up.</p>

<p>But usually if a boy is filling Scott, Foresman's orders, for instance, and he
sees half a dozen over there, he will pick up maybe that many.</p>

<p>But during our busy season, when we have stacks and stacks of orders on
the table, they don't try to put them all on a clipboard, they take a few at a
time&mdash;when they go to the sixth floor after stock, they try to be certain what
they need for several orders at one trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who else worked on Scott, Foresman other than Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, I assume that all of our boys, all of our order fillers have
worked at some time or other, because when the boys finish up the stocks they
are working, the orders they are filling, if there is anything left, regardless of
publisher, they go fill it.</p>

<p>But Scott, Foresman was one of our publishers that I would say would be
easiest for a new man to learn how to fill.</p>

<p>And we have a lot of those orders.</p>

<p>You can give a new man those orders, once he understands a little about
the alphabetical arrangement, the location of the stock, and he can go ahead
and fill orders, and you won't have to keep showing him things. They are
easier to fill.</p>

<p>Usually the boys that fill a lot of the other orders are the boys that have had
more experience overall, they have been there some time, and they will know
the general location of all the stock, and it is just easier for an experienced man
to fill some other orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When they fill the orders, they go and get the books, and bring
them down to your wrapping and mailing section?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right. And they are checked to see that they are in correct
quantities and titles and called for on the order, or the invoice.</p>

<p>Then they are weighed up on parcel post scales, if they go by parcel post, or
they are processed over on the floor if they are big enough for freight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And, as I understand it, they would first look to see if the title
would be on the first floor in your bins, and then only if it wasn't on the first
floor would they go up to some of the upper floors with your reserve stock, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of with regard to the particular
nature of the type of work that Lee Harvey Oswald did when he was working
for your company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Nothing&mdash;except that we have occasionally&mdash;we would check the
number of orders that each boy filled per day, to see if he is doing a day's work.
And each invoice which is the billing of the order, has a little section for a
checker's number. And the order filler's number. Our checker periodically
would count at the end of the day the number of orders that each order filler
filled that day.</p>

<p>We could tell at that time whether some of them were doing much more
work than others.</p>

<p>And we also kept a list of mistakes that he catches a boy making, such as
filling the wrong quantity of books, or the wrong title. We didn't do that
every day, because it is a top heavy thing, and if we have to keep a check on
your boys all the time, it is not worthwhile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you find generally&mdash;would you classify Lee Harvey
Oswald as an average employee&mdash;above average, or below average employee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I would say for the nature of the work and the time he was
there, the work that he did was a bit above average. I wasn't on that floor
constantly. The boy, from all reports to me, and what I have seen kept
working and talked little to anybody else. He just kept moving. And he did
a good day's work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was his pay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. $1.25 an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 5-day week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he miss many days of work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We had no record of him missing any days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, was your company open on Armistice Day, November
11th, or not? If you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We usually are closed on that day.</p>

<p>Now, I just cannot remember whether we were closed that day or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you what has been marked Commission Exhibit No. 496,
which appears to be a photostatic copy of a document, and I ask you to state
if you know what that is.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 496 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. This is a copy of the application blank that Oswald filled out.
I am not familiar with his handwriting, because he didn't do anything that
we have records of. All the work that he ever did was put his number or
something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, my first question is this: Is this particular form a form
of your company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is one form; yes. We changed it a little bit, and this might
have been just one that I pulled out. I can't recall whether it is the one we
use now or the one we did use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, was this a form that you were using at about the time
he came for employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him fill this out? Was it in your office or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes. He was sitting opposite me, and he filled it out on my
desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He filled this Exhibit 496 out on your desk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At this time we offer in evidence Exhibit 496.</p>

<p>495 as yet has not been offered. And I don't know if 494 has been offered
or not.</p>

<p>But, in the event it has not, we offer that in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 494, 495, and 496 were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Truly, are there any other observations you can give about
Lee Harvey Oswald as an employee during the month of October 1963, or during
the month of November, prior to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Nothing that I can recall.</p>

<p>I would speak to him in the morning when I would come through, and I
would say, "Good morning, Lee," and he would say, "Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>I would ask him how he was. Occasionally I would ask about his baby,
and he would usually smile a big smile when I asked him how his new baby
was. And that was just about the extent of my conversation that I can
remember with the boy.</p>

<p>But I usually saw him every morning as I would come through. He would
be working around the front part of the Scott, Foresman bins and shelf space.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see whether or not he seemed to strike up any
friendship or acquaintanceship with the other employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No; I never noticed that anywheres. In fact, I would be inclined&mdash;well&mdash;I
never saw him with anyone else, except occasionally talking,
maybe asking where books were or something.</p>

<p>I don't know what he would say. But very little conversation he had with
anyone.</p>

<p>And he worked by himself. His job was something that he needed no help
with, other than to ask occasionally for stock. It wasn't a teamwork job at
all.</p>

<p>Consequently, he didn't have much occasion to talk with the other boys.</p>

<p>I thought it was a pretty good trait at the time, because occasionally you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
have to spread your boys out and say, "Quit talking so much, let's get to work."</p>

<p>And it seemed to me like he paid attention to his job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice whether or not he brought his lunch to work
generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I never was aware that he brought a lunch. I would see him
occasionally in the shipping department eating some little snack or something&mdash;didn't
pay much attention. Offhand, it seemed to be not too much&mdash;a Coca-Cola,
Dr. Pepper, and some little thing.</p>

<p>Maybe he would be sitting there reading a book or a newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You would see him occasionally reading a newspaper at the lunch
hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am sure so; yes.</p>

<p>And occasionally&mdash;I didn't always go to lunch at 12&mdash;usually a little after.
And he would have to pass my door to go out the front. Occasionally I had
seen the boy go out, and maybe he would be gone long enough to get across the
street and back, with something in his hand. I seem to recall possibly a newspaper,
maybe potato chips or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever have any discussions with him about politics or anything
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Prior to November 22, did you have any discussion with him about
the Presidential motorcade, or hear him talk to anyone about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I never heard him talk to anyone, and I didn't talk to him
myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any other things about Lee Harvey Oswald prior to November 22
that you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Offhand I cannot recall a thing.</p>

<p>Just like I said&mdash;he seemed to go about his business in a quiet way, didn't
talk much, seemed to be doing a satisfactory job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you turn behind you, you will see Commission Exhibit No. 362,
and it appears to be a floor plan which is entitled, "Texas School Book Depository."
You see the room marked Mr. Truly's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does that appear to accurately depict where your office is located?
This is the front of the building here at the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And it was in the place marked Mr. Truly's office that Lee Harvey
Oswald filled out in front of you on your desk Exhibit 496?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And also the withholding slip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I want to take you to the morning of November 22d.</p>

<p>First let me ask you when you first heard your employees discussing the fact
that the motorcade would be going by the Texas School Book Depository?
Was that first on the morning of November 22d that you heard that, or at any
prior date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't recall. I don't recall hearing any particular discussion
about him coming by. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>What time did you get to work on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Around 8 o'clock, or shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see Lee Harvey Oswald at any time during that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am almost certain that I saw him early that morning as I came
in, and spoke to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where was he when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I think he was around the front part of the Scott, Foresman bins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. On the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he filling orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Apparently; yes, sir. I don't recall too close. But I am almost
certain that I talked to him that morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you recall any conversation you might have had with him, or
he might have had with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. If there was anything, I just said "Good morning, Lee",
and he said, "Good morning, sir" and that would be the extent of my conversation,
if I saw him that morning, which I am almost certain I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him any other time during that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I cannot recall. I believe I saw him that morning later on,
around his work. But I probably wasn't on that floor too much, or out on the
floor that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when did you leave for lunch, Mr. Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. As near as I know, it was between somewheres around 12:10
or shortly after, possibly 12:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At that time did you go out to lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go to eat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We didn't go anywheres. Mr. Campbell and <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is Mr. O. V. Campbell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Mr. O. V. Campbell, vice president&mdash;and I had started out for
lunch. I don't know as we had any particular place in mind. We ate at
several places around there.</p>

<p>It was around 12:10 or 12:15, I would say, to the nearest of my memory.</p>

<p>As we got to the outside of the building, we noticed that it wouldn't be long
until the motorcade would come by, and we decided to wait and watch the
President come by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where you were standing with Mr. Campbell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I would judge out in Elm Street, 10 to 15 or 20 feet from the
front steps. We first stood on the steps, the bottom steps a few minutes, and
then we walked out in the line of spectators on the side of Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you what has been marked Commission Exhibit 495, and
ask you to state, if you know, what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. This is the front entrance to our building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what direction would the camera be pointing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Almost straight out from it. It would not be&mdash;well, it could
be on a little angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I mean would the camera be pointing east, west, north, or south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. North.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And the camera would be pointing north on Exhibit 495.</p>

<p>I wonder if on that exhibit you would put the place where you and Mr.
Campbell first stood, and mark that with the letter "A" if you would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The street curved there, I suppose. I think possibly along here
somewheres.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have marked a letter "A" on Exhibit 495. Now, I believe
you said that afterwards you went and moved out towards the street, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to put up on the board Commission Exhibit No. 361.
The bottom of the picture is relatively north, sir.</p>

<p>And the top faces roughly south.</p>

<p>And here is the Texas School Book Depository Building&mdash;located at Houston
and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if you could put on Exhibit 361 with the letter "T"
the spot at which you were standing when you moved to a closer position to
watch the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I could be off a few feet, but I believe possibly over this way
just a bit&mdash;that is within 3 or 4 or 5 feet of this area.</p>

<p>We were almost out in this. And I think when the motorcade came around,
we probably pushed out even a bit farther.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, by this, you are referring to the entrance to the parkway,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you say that you are either at the spot marked by the
letter "T" or perhaps a little bit to the east of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And that you gradually might have moved a little bit towards the
south, towards the parkway, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Do you know approximately what time you got there, Mr. Truly? To the
best of your recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. 3 or 4 minutes after we reached the entrance, the walkway,
we stood on the steps 2 or 3 minutes, and then I don't believe&mdash;we just gradually
moved out a bit.</p>

<p>And then when the policemen leading the motorcade came off of Main on
to Houston, we saw them coming, and then we just moved out a little farther to
the edge of the parkway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice any other company employees with you other
than Mr. Campbell at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, I did. I noticed several. Mrs. Reid was standing there
close. And it seemed like there were several of the other employees standing
out in front of the building. But I cannot&mdash;I think Bill Shelley was standing
over to my right as I faced the motorcade&mdash;somewheres in that area.</p>

<p>I noticed just before the motorcade passed there were, I believe, three of
our colored boys had come out and started up, and two of them came back.
And I didn't see them when the motorcade passed.</p>

<p>But they had started across Houston Street up Elm, and they came back
later on, and I think those were the ones that were&mdash;two of them were the
ones on the fifth floor. Possibly they could not see over the crowd. They
are short boys. I wasn't doing too well at that, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>What did you next see with reference to the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Do you mind <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to turn that over, sir? Will that be easier for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It might be easier for the gentlemen when I point this out.</p>

<p>Now, what was the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. My question is what did you see with reference to the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. All right.</p>

<p>We saw the motorcycle escort come off of Main and turn onto Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Main would be down here, and it would be coming off Houston,
heading towards the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Headed towards the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. And it went on down this way. And immediately <span class="locked">after&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By "this way" you mean the street marked Parkway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I assume that is the underpass that you have marked Parkway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The street leading to the expressway, that diagonal street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>And the President's car following close behind came along at an average
speed of 10 or 15 miles an hour. It wasn't that much, because they were getting
ready to turn. And the driver of the Presidential car swung out too far to
the right, and he came almost within an inch of running into this little abutment
here, between Elm and the Parkway. And he slowed down perceptibly
and pulled back to the left to get over into the middle lane of the parkway.
Not being familiar with the street, he came too far out this way when he made
his turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He came too far to the north before he made his curve, and as he
curved&mdash;as he made his left turn from Houston onto the street leading to the
expressway, he almost hit this north curb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right. Just before he got to it, he had to almost stop, to
pull over to the left.</p>

<p>If he had maintained his speed, he would probably have hit this little section
here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, what is your best estimate of the speed as he started to go down the
street here marked Parkway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He picked up a little speed along here, and then seemed to have
fallen back into line, and I would say 10 or 12 miles an hour in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what did you see happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I heard an explosion, which I thought was a toy cannon or a
loud firecracker from west of the building. Nothing happened at this first
explosion. Everything was frozen. And immediately after two more explosions,
which I realized that I thought was a gun, a rifle of some kind.</p>

<p>The President's&mdash;I saw the President's car swerve to the left and stop somewheres
down in this area. It is misleading here. And that is the last I saw
of his car, because this crowd, when the third shot rang out&mdash;there was a large
crowd all along this abutment here, this little wall, and there was some around
us in front&mdash;they began screaming and falling to the ground. And the people
in front of myself and Mr. Campbell surged back, either in terror or panic. They
must have seen this thing. I became separated from Mr. Campbell. They
just practically bore me back to the first step on the entrance of our building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you saw the President's car seem to stop, how long did it
appear to stop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It would be hard to say over a second or two or something like
that. I didn't see&mdash;I just saw it stop. I don't know. I didn't see it start up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you stopped looking at it, or you were distracted by something
else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes. The crowd in front of me kind of congealed around me and
bore me back through weight of numbers, and I lost sight of it.</p>

<p>I think there were a lot of people trying to get out of the way of something.
They didn't know what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do or see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I heard a policeman in this area along here make a remark, "Oh,
goddam," or something like that. I just remember that. It wasn't a motorcycle
policeman. It was one of the Dallas policeman, I think&mdash;words to that
effect.</p>

<p>I wouldn't know him. I just remember there was a policeman standing along
in this area about 7, 8, or 10 feet from me.</p>

<p>But as I came back here, and everybody was screaming and hollering, just
moments later I saw a young motorcycle policeman run up to the building, up
the steps to the entrance of our building. He ran right by me. And he was
pushing people out of the way. He pushed a number of people out of the way
before he got to me. I saw him coming through, I believe. As he ran up the
stairway&mdash;I mean up the steps, I was almost to the steps, I ran up and caught
up with him. I believe I caught up with him inside the lobby of the building,
or possibly the front steps. I don't remember that close. But I remember it
occurred to me that this man wants on top of the building. He doesn't know
the plan of the floor. And that is&mdash;that just popped in my mind, and I ran in
with him. As we got in the lobby, almost on the inside of the first floor, this
policeman asked me where the stairway is. And I said, "This way". And I ran
diagonally across to the northwest corner of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, let me, if I can&mdash;turning to Exhibit 362 again, I wonder if
you would, with this&mdash;we can first do it with this pen, if you would&mdash;trace your
route inside there. Point out the place inside the lobby where you talked to
the policeman, where he said "where is the stairway."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I believe along right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Could you put a "T" on Exhibit 362, if you would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I could be wrong, but I am almost positive that is the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now&mdash;and this is inside the glass or plastic set of doors shown on Exhibit 495,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, he said to you what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Where is the stairway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what did you say to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I said "This way."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I wonder if you would take this pen and show the route
that you took with the policeman, or take your own pen, if you would, sir&mdash;starting
from point "T" on Exhibit 362.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I ran in front of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You better mark on the exhibit, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Took this route. There is a swinging door and a counter, what
we call our will call counter right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is it here, or here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, wait a minute.</p>

<p>There&mdash;right here. We came in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you still want to put point "T" up here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No. This was on the steps, wasn't it? This is where I am sure
he asked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You better cross out the other one, then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I saw this thing here, and I thought it was that little swinging
door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be the main door?</p>

<p>Now, you have point "T."</p>

<p>Now, will you trace the route from point "T"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We came through this door here. The policeman right behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. This is a counter and this is a counter built in that cut inside&mdash;this
is where our customers come that pick up books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>When you are pointing to the counter on Exhibit 362, you are pointing to
a rectangle that appears to be located immediately to the west of the glass&mdash;looks
like a glass partition to your office, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You call that the will call counter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. There is a little swinging door that swings in and out that we have
there. We never keep it locked. But on the bottom is a little bolt that you
can lock it to keep people from pulling it out or pushing it in. And this bolt
had slid out. It has done that on occasions. I started to run through this
little opening, and I ran into the door, and the bolt hung against the side of
the counter, and the policeman ran into my back. And so I just pulled it
back and continued on through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, the door didn't swing through. The bolt stuck. So you were stuck
by the door. The policeman ran into you. And then you had to stop and
pull the door back and go through it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then where did you go? You might continue with your pen on
Exhibit 362, showing the route.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Now, you have cut sort of diagonally across towards the rear, and you have
come to the west elevator in the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this, Mr. Truly. I note on Exhibit 362 right where
you came in there appears to be some stairs there. Why didn't you go up
those stairs, instead of running to the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Those stairs only reached to the second floor, and they wouldn't
have any way of getting up to the top without going to the back stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. So this is the logical stairway that goes all the way to the seventh
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you are pointing to the stairway in what would be the northwest
corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you got to the elevator, and what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I looked up. This is two elevators in the same well. This elevator
over <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to the west one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am pointing to the west one. This elevator was on the fifth
floor. Also, the east elevator&mdash;as far as I can tell&mdash;both of them were on the
fifth floor at that time.</p>

<p>This elevator will come down if the gates are down, and you push a button.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Which elevator is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The west one. But the east one will not come down unless you
get on it and bring it down. You cannot call it if the gates are down.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is the east elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The east elevator?</p>

<p>There is a button and a little bell here. I <span class="locked">pressed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You might put a "B" on Exhibit 362 by the elevator for "button."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right on this surface. There is a little button. I pressed
the button and the elevator didn't move.</p>

<p>I called upstairs "Turn loose the elevator."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say call up, in what kind of a voice did you call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Real loud. I suppose in an excited voice. But loud enough that
anyone could have heard me if they had not been over stacking or making a
little noise. But I rang the bell and pushed this button.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I said, "Turn loose the elevator."</p>

<p>Those boys understand that language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That means if they have the gates up, they go pull the gates
down, and when you press the button, you can pull it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And how many times did you yell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Two times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you had first pushed the button?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right. I had pressed the button twice, I believe, and
called up for the elevator twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>First of all, did the elevator come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I went up on a run up the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you again follow&mdash;from Point B, could you show which
way you went?</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. What is this here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is to show this is a stairway, and there is a stairway above
it, too. But you went up the stairs right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay. And where was this officer at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. This officer was right behind me and coming up the stairway.</p>

<p>By the time I reached the second floor, the officer was a little further
behind me than he was on the first floor, I assume&mdash;I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he a few feet behind you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He was a few feet. It is hard for me to tell. I ran right on
around to my left, started to continue on up the stairway to the third floor,
and on up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when you say you ran on to your left, did you look straight
ahead to see whether there was anyone in that area, or were you intent on just
going upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. If there had been anybody in that area, I would have seen him on
the outside. But I was content&mdash;I was trying to show the officer the pathway
up, where the elevators&mdash;I mean where the stairways continued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I hand you what has been marked Exhibit 497.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 497, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is entitled "Texas School Book Depository, Diagram of
Second Floor."</p>

<p>You can sit down, if you would, please, Mr. Truly.</p>

<p>And would you, on Exhibit 497, if you would kind of take an arrow to show
the route that you took going out&mdash;or up from the first floor, and starting up
the stairs towards the third.</p>

<p>Now, you marked that with pen.</p>

<p>Could you put a "T" on that, if you would, please?</p>

<p>Now, there appears to be some kind of a vestibule or hall of one kind or
another with the No. 22 in a circle on it, on Exhibit 497. Is this completely
clear, or are there books there from time to time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No; that is always clear. There is a few cartons of office
stock, invoices, blank invoices and stationery and stuff up and down here. But
there is always a pathway. There is a post, right about where this 22 is.
You can always clear it and come by there. I don't think there would ever be
stock here that would obstruct your view of the other area across there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I hand you what has been marked Commission Exhibit 498.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 498 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I ask you to state, if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes. This is the vestibule, when you first come up the stairs on the
second floor&mdash;this is what you will find right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, as you take a look at the picture Exhibit 498, is this a post
immediately to the left side of the picture, to the extreme left of the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is this, to the extreme left? Is that the wall for the staircase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; there is an opening on this side, and the staircase is back
over here. This picture is just part of this vestibule out here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what direction does the camera appear to be pointing, or
what is shown there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It appears to be pointing east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And I see a door with a glass in it.</p>

<p>Could you show where on this diagram Exhibit 497 this door with the
glass is?</p>

<p>Do you see a number with an arrow pointing to the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What number is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It is number 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Number 23, the arrow points to the door that has the
glass in it.</p>

<p>Now, as you raced around, how far did you start up the stairs towards
the third floor there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I suppose I was up two or three steps before I realized the officer
wasn't following me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I came back to the second floor landing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I heard some voices, or a voice, coming from the area of the
lunchroom, or the inside vestibule, the area of 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. And I see that there appears to be on the second
floor diagram, a room marked lunchroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I ran over and looked in this door No. 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Through the glass, or was the door open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't know. I think I opened the door. I feel like I did.
I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It could have been open or it could have been closed, you do
not remember?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The chances are it was closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You thought you opened it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I think I opened it. I opened the door back and leaned in this
way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I saw the officer almost directly in the doorway of the lunchroom
facing Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where was Lee Harvey Oswald at the time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He was at the front of the lunchroom, not very far inside&mdash;he
was just inside the lunchroom door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. 2 or 3 feet, possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you put an "O" where you saw Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>You have put an "O" on Exhibit 497.</p>

<p>What did you see or hear the officer say or do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. When I reached there, the officer had his gun pointing at Oswald.
The officer turned this way and said, "This man work here?" And I
said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Then we left Lee Harvey Oswald immediately and continued
to run up the stairways until we reached the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this now. How far was the officer's gun from Lee Harvey
Oswald when he asked the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It would be hard for me to say, but it seemed to me like it was
almost touching him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What portion of his body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Towards the middle portion of his body.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see Lee Harvey Oswald's hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am sure I could, yes. I could see most of him, because I was
looking in the room on an angle, and they were this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say you were looking in the room on an <span class="locked">angle&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. What I mean&mdash;this door offsets the lunchroom door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By this door, you mean door No. 23 is at an angle to door No.
24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes. One this way and the other one is this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Could you see whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald had anything in either
hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I noticed nothing in either hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see both of his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am sure I did. I could be wrong, but I am almost sure I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how long did Officer Baker stand there with Lee Harvey
Oswald after you saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He left him immediately after I told him&mdash;after he asked me,
does this man work here. I said, yes. The officer left him immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear Lee Harvey Oswald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Not a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any expression on his face? Or weren't you paying
attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He didn't seem to be excited or overly afraid or anything. He
might have been a bit startled, like I might have been if somebody confronted
me. But I cannot recall any change in expression of any kind on his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I hand you what the reporter has marked as Exhibit 499.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 499 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I ask you to state if you know what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is the interior of the lunchroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what direction does the camera appear to be pointing on
Exhibit 499?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. East.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And does this appear to be the doorway in the very foreground of
the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Which doorway would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Number 24. The camera seems to be right in the doorway
when that picture was taken. You cannot see the doorway very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask you a question?</p>

<p>Do you know why it was that the officer didn't follow you up the stairs, but
instead was distracted, as it were, and went with Lee Harvey Oswald into the
lunchroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I never knew until a day or two ago that he said he saw a
movement, saw a man going away from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As he was going up the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. As he got to the second floor landing. While I was going around,
he saw a movement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And he followed that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He saw a movement in the lunchroom or a man go into
the lunchroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He saw the back of a man inside the door&mdash;I suppose door No. 23.</p>

<p>But that isn't my statement. I didn't learn about that, you see, until the
other day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe we have some additional pictures of the lunchroom.
Perhaps we can just briefly identify them.</p>

<p>Here is a picture which has been marked Commission Exhibit 500.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 500 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I will ask you to state what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. This is a picture of the lunchroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What direction is the camera facing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. East.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about Exhibit 501?</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 501 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. This picture is part of the lunchroom. And I would say the
camera must be facing northeast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about Exhibit 502?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. This is the lunchroom looking west. Northwest, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is this door clear to the left of the picture, the door in which
you saw Officer Baker standing when he was talking to Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mr. Truly, you then went up to the third floor with
Officer Baker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We continued on until we reached the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, by the way, I have used the name Officer Baker.</p>

<p>When did you find out what his name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I never did know for sure what his name was until he was
down to the building and you were interviewing him last week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This was on Friday, March 20th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I had heard his name was Baker or Burton or various other names.
But I never did try to find out what his name was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 502 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mr. Truly, did you notice when you got to the third floor&mdash;first
of all. On the second floor, was there any elevator there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, I am sure not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. When we reached the fifth floor, the east elevator was on that
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the west elevator? Was that on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. I am sure it wasn't, or I could not have seen the east
elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am almost positive that it wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You said you released the elevator and let it go down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No; the east elevator was the one on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Exhibit 487 appears to be a diagram of the fifth floor.
As I understand it, you might mark on that diagram the way you went from
the stairs over to the east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, I started around towards the stairway, and then I noted
that this east elevator was there. So I told the officer, "Come on, here is an
elevator," and then we ran down to the east side, and got on the east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you put the letter "T" at the end of that line, please?</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Now, where did you go with the east elevator, to what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We rode the east elevator to the seventh floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you stop at the sixth floor at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the seventh floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We ran up a little stairway that leads out through a little
penthouse on to the roof.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do on the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We ran immediately to the west side of the building. There is
a wall around the building that you cannot see over without getting your foot
between the mortar of the stones and, or some such toehold. We did that
and looked over the ground and the railroad tracks below. There we saw
many officers and a lot of spectators, people running up and down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the officer say to you why he wanted to go up to the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No. At that time, he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever prior to meeting you again on March 20th tell you why
he wanted to go on the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you think the shots came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I thought the shots came from the vicinity of the railroad or the
WPA project, behind the WPA project west of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any conversation with the officer that you can remember?
About where you thought the shots came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes. When&mdash;some time in the course, I believe, after we reached
the roof, the officer looked down over the boxcars and the railroad tracks and
the crowd below. Then he looked around the edge of the roof for any evidence
of anybody being there. And then looked up at the runways and the big sign
on the roof.</p>

<p>He saw nothing.</p>

<p>He came over. And some time about then I said, "Officer, I think"&mdash;let's
back up.</p>

<p>I believe the officer told me as we walked down into the seventh floor, "Be
careful, this man will blow your head off."</p>

<p>And I told the officer that I didn't feel like the shots came from the building.</p>

<p>I said, "I think we are wasting our time up here," or words to that effect,
"I don't believe these shots came from the building."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything to that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't recall exactly what he said. I believe he said, yes, or
somebody said they did, or some such thing as that. I don't remember. I have
heard so many things since, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Truly, on March 20th, you and I visited about this particular incident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
you have related about the running into the building and up the stairs with
this officer, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And as a matter of fact you and Officer Baker and I tried to reconstruct
the incident in an effort to determine how long it took you to do all this,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And do you remember watching me getting over with Officer Baker
in front of the sheriff's office on Market Street&mdash;pardon me&mdash;Houston Street, with
a stopwatch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you saw Officer Baker race his motorcycle over and come
in front of the building, and then you ran in with him, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what is the fact as to whether or not you and Officer
Baker and I recreated the incident as you have testified to here, going into the
lobby with the conversation you had with Officer Baker, and running into that
swinging door, and going back to the elevator and pushing the elevator button,
and then calling or yelling twice for the elevator to come down, and then coming
up the stairs to the second floor. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When we recreated that incident, did we walk or run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We walked. We trotted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We trotted.</p>

<p>Did we get out of breath, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did we go at about the speed that you feel you went on that day
with Officer Baker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I think so&mdash;which was a little more than a trot, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember offhand what the stopwatch timed us at&mdash;I think
we did it twice, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir&mdash;not from the time that he got on his motorcycle, I don't
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. But I was thinking it was somewheres under 2 minutes. Between
a minute and a half and 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, I think, will be able to testify to that in the morning.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But in reconstructing the incident, you went more or less
at a similar pace, took about the same time you did on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. As far as I can tell; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You ran at about the same speed, do you believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>We tried to&mdash;we had a few people we had to push our way through to start in
the building the other time, and possibly didn't run quite so fast at first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you say that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I said when the officer and I ran in, we were shouldering people
aside in front of the building, so we possibly were slowed a little bit more
coming in than we were when he and I came in March 20th. I don't believe so.
But it wouldn't be enough to matter there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you say that the reconstruction that we did on March
20th was a minimum or a maximum time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Oh, I would say that would be the minimum time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Truly, when you took the elevator to the fifth&mdash;from the fifth
to the seventh floor, that east elevator did you see the west elevator at all as
you passed the sixth floor, when you got to the seventh floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; because&mdash;I could not see the west elevator while
operating the east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean because you were not looking at it, or you just couldn't
see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, the back of the east elevator is solid metal, and if I
passed&mdash;yes; I could. I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
I could see it from the fifth floor. I didn't notice it anywheres up there.
I wasn't really looking for it, however.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, after you got&mdash;when did you notice that west elevator next?
If you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe you said when you first saw the elevators, you thought
they were both on the same floor, the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then how do you explain that when you got to the fifth floor,
one of the elevators was not there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't know, sir. I think one of my boys was getting stock off
the fifth floor on the back side, and probably moved the elevator at the time&mdash;somewheres
between the time we were running upstairs. And I would not
have remembered that. I mean I wouldn't have really heard that, with the
commotion we were making running up the enclosed stairwell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes. When coming down I am sure I saw Jack Dougherty getting
some books off the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Now, this is so dim in my mind that I could be making a mistake.</p>

<p>But I believe that he was getting some stock, that he had already gone back
to work, and that he was getting some stock off the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You really don't know who was operating the elevator, then, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your best guess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. My best guess is that Jack Dougherty was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, after you got down from the seventh floor, you then went
down to the sixth floor with Officer Baker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he look around on the sixth floor at all or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Just before we got on the elevator on the seventh floor, Officer
Baker ran over and looked in a little room on the seventh floor, and glanced
around on that floor, which is open, and it didn't take much of a search. And
then we reached the sixth floor. I stopped. He glanced over the sixth floor
quickly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see the southeast corner of the sixth floor from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't think so; no, sir. You could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Then we continued on down, and we saw officers on the fourth
floor.</p>

<p>I don't recall that we stopped any more until we reached the first floor. But
I do recall there was an officer on the fourth floor, by the time we got down
that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>And then you got down eventually to the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how long after these shots do you think it took you to
go all the way up and look around the roof and come all the way down again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Oh, we might have been gone between 5 and 10 minutes. It is
hard to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got back to the first floor, or what did
you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. When I got back to the first floor, at first I didn't see anything
except officers running around, reporters in the place. There was a regular
madhouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had they sealed off the building yet, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am sure they had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Then in a few minutes&mdash;it could have been moments or minutes
at a time like that&mdash;I noticed some of my boys were over in the west corner of
the shipping department, and there were several officers over there taking their
names and addresses, and so forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
There were other officers in other parts of the building taking other employees,
like office people's names. I noticed that Lee Oswald was not among
these boys.</p>

<p>So I picked up the telephone and called Mr. Aiken down at the other warehouse
who keeps our application blanks. Back up there.</p>

<p>First I mentioned to Mr. Campbell&mdash;I asked Bill Shelley if he had seen him,
he looked around and said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you asked Bill Shelley if he had seen whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Lee Oswald. I said, "Have you seen him around lately," and
he said no.</p>

<p>So Mr. Campbell is standing there, and I said, "I have a boy over here missing.
I don't know whether to report it or not." Because I had another one or two
out then. I didn't know whether they were all there or not. He said, "What
do you think"? And I got to thinking. He said, "Well, we better do it anyway."
It was so quick after that.</p>

<p>So I picked the phone up then and called Mr. Aiken, at the warehouse, and
got the boy's name and general description and telephone number and address
at Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any address for him in Dallas, or did you just have
an address in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Just the address in Irving. I knew nothing of this Dallas address.
I didn't know he was living away from his family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, would that be the address and the description as shown
on this application, Exhibit 496?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ask for the name and addresses of any other employees
who might have been missing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why didn't you ask for any other employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is the only one that I could be certain right then was missing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do after you got that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Chief Lumpkin of the Dallas Police Department was standing a
few feet from me. I told Chief Lumpkin that I had a boy missing over here&mdash;"I
don't know whether it amounts to anything or not." And I gave him his
description. And he says, "Just a moment. We will go tell Captain Fritz."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. So Chief Lumpkin had several officers there that he was talking
to, and I assumed that he gave him some instructions of some nature&mdash;I didn't
hear it. And then he turned to me and says, "Now we will go upstairs".</p>

<p>So we got on one of the elevators, I don't know which, and rode up to the sixth
floor. I didn't know Captain Fritz was on the sixth floor. And he was over in
the northwest corner of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the stairs there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; by the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. And there were other officers with him. Chief Lumpkin stepped
over and told Captain Fritz that I had something that I wanted to tell him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. So Captain Fritz left the men he was with and walked over about
8 or 10 feet and said, "What is it, Mr. Truly," or words to that effect.</p>

<p>And I told him about this boy missing and gave him his address and telephone
number and general description. And he says, "Thank you, Mr. Truly. We will
take care of it."</p>

<p>And I went back downstairs in a few minutes.</p>

<p>There was a reporter followed me away from that spot, and asked me who
Oswald was. I told the reporter, "You must have ears like a bird, or something.
I don't want to say anything about a boy I don't know anything about. This is
a terrible thing." Or words to that effect.</p>

<p>I said, "Don't bother me. Don't mention the name. Let's find something out."</p>

<p>So I went back downstairs with Chief Lumpkin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got on the sixth floor, did you happen to go over to
the southeast corner of the sixth floor at about that time or not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I sure didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you get over to the southeast corner of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That I can't answer. I don't remember when I went over there.
It was sometime before I learned that they had found either the rifle or the
spent shell cases. It could have been at the time I went up and told them about
Lee Harvey Oswald being missing. I cannot remember. But I didn't know it.
I didn't see them find them, and I didn't know at the time&mdash;I don't know how
long they had the things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There has been some testimony here, Mr. Truly, about some bins
for storing books on the fifth floor near the stairway. I am going to hand you
an exhibit which has been marked as Commission Exhibit 490, and ask you to
state, if you know&mdash;were you there when these pictures were taken on the fifth
floor? On Friday, March 20th?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The fifth floor; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes; I was, I believe. Some of them I may not have been when
all of them were taken. I was not there when this picture was taken, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are familiar with those bins on the fifth floor, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have those bins by the stairway been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, it would be hard for me to say, but they have been there,
I suppose, almost from the time we moved in&mdash;nearly 2 years. They were
there at the time of November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Commission Exhibit 487, the line marked "W", will you state
whether or not this appears to be the approximate line where the bins are
located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Can you see over those bins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. You cannot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I mean when you are at the window&mdash;say you are in the southwest
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; you cannot. They obscure the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, there was a floor laying project that was going along on the sixth floor
at about the time of November 22, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you Commission Exhibit 483, could you state, if you
know, approximately where on the sixth floor they were laying new plywood
floor around November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. This is <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is north right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. They were in this area right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, there is a blank line that appears to have a "W" at one
end or the other. Would that be a fairly <span class="locked">accurate&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir; in the west end of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where they were laying the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is where they were laying the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when you were&mdash;were you familiar with the fact that they
had moved books in the process of laying that floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I knew they had to. I didn't know where they moved them
particularly until that time. I don't suppose I had been up on that floor in
several days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By that time, you mean November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did it appear that they had moved them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. They moved a long row of books down parallel to the windows on
the south side, following the building, and had quite a lot of cartons on the
north&mdash;let's see&mdash;the southeast corner of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sometime on November 22d did you go to the southeast corner
of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice anything particularly about the books that were
in the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I didn't at that time&mdash;with the exception of a few cartons that
were moved. But I did not know any pattern that the boys used in putting these
cartons up there. They were just piled up there more or less at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, handing you what has been marked as Exhibit 503, which
is a picture, does this appear to portray the southeast corner of the sixth floor
as you saw it on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 503 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I notice some rows of books along the east wall. Did those
books go all the way to the corner or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. They did not in front of the window extend very much in height,
but they did go all the way on the floor to the corner of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this prior to November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got there on November 22d, did those books still go to
the corner of the east wall of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. There were several cartons that had been moved out
of the corner and apparently placed on top of the cartons next to them in front
of the east window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any books that are called Rolling Readers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what floor those Rolling Readers are usually kept
on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. The first floor and the sixth floor. Most of them are on the sixth
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know where on the sixth floor the Rolling Readers are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Approximately where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. They were&mdash;I would say they were thirty or forty feet from the
corner. They were not in the area that the boys moved books from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, handing you Exhibit 483, I wonder if you would mark with
your pen the letters "RR" for Rolling Readers. Would there have been any
occasion at all to move any Rolling Readers from the area you have marked
on Exhibit 483 to the southeast corner of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; because the boys had not finished much of the plywood
work, and they would&mdash;none of that stock was moved at that time for any
purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are the Rolling Reader cartons average size or small size or
large size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. They are much smaller than the average size cartons on that
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you intend to offer all of these exhibits en bloc later on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Now, handing you Commission Exhibit 504, there appear to be some boxes
near a window on a floor of your building. And I note that on two of the
boxes they are marked "Ten Rolling Readers." Are those the Rolling Reader
cartons that you referred to, with the letters "RR" on Commission Exhibit 483?</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 504 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The Rolling Reader boxes were not ordinarily in that
southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. That was not the place for them. They were 40 feet
or so away.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask&mdash;the job that Oswald had, how did you
designate it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, he filled orders.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He was an order filler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Order filler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you keep records of the orders that are filled by
each order filler every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Not every day; no, sir. Occasionally we would double check
on the employees, or the checker would count up the number and give me the
number each employee filled in that day, or several days in succession for a
whole week.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would you know what orders Oswald filled November
22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I would not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You would have no way of checking that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No. They would have been some orders that he filled the 21st
that were not checked and out of the house on the 22d. And I could not tell
how many he filled or when he filled his orders, no, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When an order filler fills an order, does he make his
initial or mark on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir; he does. Up there where it says "L", which is layout,
he puts his number, and then the checker puts his number under "C" when
he checks the order and sees that it is all right, and sends it on for packing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Well, it would seem to me that every order that was
filled on a particular day by an order filler could be identified as to the individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. You see, we don't always get out our orders the same day they
are shipped. The order fillers fill lots of orders, and they are filling orders
on up to quitting time in the afternoon, and those wouldn't go out until the
next day, or sometime, if they get ahead of the checker. They don't put the
date on them when they fill them.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What I am trying to find out&mdash;is there any way to
trace by the orders that were filled by Oswald on the morning of November 22d
as to whether or not in the process of filling orders he was taken to the sixth
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; we could not tell whether he filled any orders that might
be dated November 22d&mdash;might have been filled&mdash;if they were dated November
22d and had Oswald's number on it, we would know that he filled those
on November 22d. But if they were billed and dated on the 20th and 21st, and
there was a number of those filled, we could not tell how many of those he
filled on the 22d.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you ever gone back through your orders for the
22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Just to take a survey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. We have thousands and thousands of accounts, and they run
from A to Z alphabetically in our files. We would have to take&mdash;we would
have to go through every invoice in each file, from A to Z, in order to find
any orders he might have filled on that day. And it would be hard to prove
that he filled them on that date because, unless we found one that had his
number on it and was dated November 22d&mdash;because we know he wasn't there
after that&mdash;but if it was dated November 21st, he could easily have filled a
good number of those orders that morning of the 22d. But we could not tell
whether he filled them the 21st or the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Truly, in line with Congressman Ford's questions, was there
ever a clipboard found in your building at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir. Sometime later there was a clipboard found that had
two or three orders on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were those orders dated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where the clipboard was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I later learned it was found up on the sixth floor, near the
stairway, behind some cartons. I do not remember just exactly how many
orders were on it, but I think it was only two or three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember who found it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. A boy by the name of Frankie Kaiser.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is he still one of your employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether this was ever identified as having ever
belonged to any particular employee of yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, he brought the clipboard to Bill Shelley and told him about
it, and he said, "This is an old clipboard I used to use. This is the one that
Oswald was using." It was a kind of homemade affair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say he brought it to Bill Shelley, who are you referring
to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I am referring to Frankie Kaiser who brought the clipboard with
the orders downstairs and told Bill Shelley that he had found Oswald's clipboard
with some orders on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had those orders ever been filled or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. You see, when they fill the orders, they take them off
the clipboard. They may have 25 on the clipboard, and after a while they will
have 15 or 10 or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not those orders were ever eventually
filled that were found on the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir; they were filled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do with the clipboard and the order blanks that
were on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I think someone else filled the order blanks and the clipboard lay
around there for a while until it was mentioned. I don't recall what happened
to it. At the time nobody considered it of too much significance, I suppose&mdash;that
the boy was just filling orders up there and he had just thrown his clipboard
over. I believe that someone from a government agency either got the clipboard
or looked at it. I have this thing all mixed up. It hasn't been very long
ago, you know, about the clipboard. I don't know the solution of it. They were
trying to identify this clipboard just a short while ago for someone&mdash;the FBI
or the Secret Service, or it could be you, could it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Just shortly before you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let me ask you this question?</p>

<p>Are there any ways in which your orders are posted that show anything along
the lines that Congressman Ford suggested as to who might fill an order or
when an order would be posted? In other words, if you come to an order and
you see that the order is dated maybe November 21st, but you do not know
whether it was filled on November 21st or November 22d, would your posting
system of entries on your ledger or journal in any way show when it was filled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. The date that we go by is the date the checker checks
the order, and then he puts the date stamp on it. He puts it over on the table
in a little conveyor belt, and the boys wrap it. When he separates the packing
list and the invoice itself&mdash;he puts the packing list and the label with the order.
Then he dates the invoice as of that date, and it goes upstairs to be matched with
the other copies, and then charged to the customer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you mentioned earlier that periodically your checkers get a
check to ascertain how many orders were filled by the various employees. Do
you know of any such check made on the morning of November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I do not recall having made a check in several days before
that. We would usually run a check of errors for a week, and then we would
run a check occasionally of orders filled. And checking on the errors the various
boys made&mdash;maybe we have an unusual number for us of teachers writing in
saying that they got the wrong book. So we try to check and see which one of
these boys possibly was making these errors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is it your testimony that you do not recall any check being made
on November 22d, or you are sure there was no check on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. There was no check that I recall. And I am sure there wasn't.</p>

<p>(At this point, the Chairman left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could you tell us the approximate date that this individual
found the clipboard and brought it to your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it a few days after the assassination, or several
weeks?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I think it was just a few days afterward because&mdash;now, we would
have to check upstairs. If these orders are not filled and processed and gone
upstairs and matched with the copies in several days there, then we go looking
for the order like the boys missed them. We have copies in the office, and if
they do not come through in a reasonable time, we think that someone has lost
some orders, and we get to checking them. If we cannot find them, we have to
duplicate the orders.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, if 2 weeks had passed without the order
being filled according to your records, you would have instituted a more thorough
search to find out where the unfilled order blank was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;less than that, I would say, because we do not&mdash;our
customers would probably write to us before then, if they did not receive it.
But the girls on it&mdash;usually 3 or 4 days, if those orders have not cleared, they
come to check about them, to see if we are holding one back because we do not
have the stock, or if we have lost it, the boys have lost it.</p>

<p>(At this point, the Chairman entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who is the man who brought the clipboard to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Bill Shelley called my attention to it. At that time I do not recall
anything being done except maybe one of the boys filling the orders and just
forgetting about that part of it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To your best recollection, who gave the clipboard to Bill
Shelley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Frankie Kaiser.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was he an employee of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you know generally where Kaiser found the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you point it out to us on one of the exhibits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The diagram of the sixth floor has been marked as Exhibit No.
483. Perhaps you can mark on Exhibit No. 483 with the letter "C" where you
think the clipboard was found.</p>

<p>I might at this point on the record say for the Commission that Exhibit 506
purports to be the position of the clipboard when it was discovered&mdash;the clipboard
is circled, and the number on the picture, on Exhibit 506, is numbered 36,
and on the Exhibit 483 appears at the end of the arrow with the number 36 on
it, which is near where Mr. Truly put his "C". And the number 35 on that
same exhibit&mdash;the number 35 will be shown tomorrow to be the position of the
rifle when it was discovered.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And 36 is the position of the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I don't think you can take that as evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is not evidence. This is just background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is really an offer of proof on our part. That is the most you
can consider it&mdash;because we intend to take the deposition of Kaiser who found
the clipboard.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is there someone here, the staff or Mr. Truly, who knows
approximately when the clipboard was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir. I can give you that date in about one minute. According
to our records, Frankie Kaiser, when interviewed on December 2d, said
that on the morning of December 2d he found a clipboard which he had made
and which he had turned over to Lee Harvey Oswald with orders. And we
have a list of the orders also in one of the Commission documents. It is Document
7, page 381.</p>

<p>But we are going to have to actually take the deposition of Mr. Kaiser, which
we will do when we go to Dallas next week or the week after, or whenever we
get to him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Three more pictures, Mr. Truly.</p>

<p>I hand you what the reporter has marked as Exhibit 505.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 505 for
identification.)</p>

<p>I ask you to state if this appears to be the stairway leading from the second
to the third floor, or can't you tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And that is the stairway that you went up two or three steps before
you came down to get Officer Baker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I note with regard to the floor plan on the second floor that
when you want to get to the lunchroom from the elevator, if you want to get
to the lunchroom from the west elevator you have to walk in the area through
that door marked number 23. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you want to get there from the east elevator, what do you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, there is a side door, a north door, coming into the lunchroom
that they can come through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does that north door appear on Exhibit 501?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That appears to be located east of the Coca Cola machine, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, if someone wanted to take an elevator and get off on the
second floor, and go through the back door to get to the lunchroom, would there
be any way for that elevator to leave the second floor other than for someone
to get back on that east elevator and personally operate it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, the east elevator you have to actually have an
operator on it and it cannot be moved by just pushing a button?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. One other question. Just what are Rolling Readers? Is Rolling
a company or what is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, if you would look at it you wouldn't know what it was after
you opened the box. But it is a new concept in material for reading for children
in the first grade, kindergarten and so forth. They are little blocks with words
on them that roll out, and then you turn them over. It is something like&mdash;I
know way back in my childhood they would use number blocks and things like
that. But it has words and sentences and things they can put together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. A square like dice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right. It looks like dice, only they are bigger. They have
the theory that these can interest a lot of children because of the noise they
put out here, and they pick them up when they hit the floor and put them
together into sentences and things. Something to stimulate the interest of
children who are not quite as advanced in their reading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are they relatively heavy or light cartons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. They are very light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The cartons themselves. About how much would a carton of 10
Rolling Readers weigh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't think they would weigh over between five and ten pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And by 10 Rolling Readers you mean there were 10 sets of the
Rolling Readers in each of these cartons shown on Exhibit 504?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At this time we offer in evidence exhibits 490 through 506
inclusive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 490 through
506, inclusive, for identification, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Mr. Truly, I think I heard you say when you were describing
the first contact that you had with Oswald that you said, "That is the last
time I saw him until November 16th."</p>

<p>Did I hear you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I did not. If I did, it was a mistake. I saw him
on October 16th, the morning he came to work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I put down here that was the last time you had seen him until
November 16th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. For the record, if I said that, that is wrong. I meant October
16th.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Which was the next morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That was the next morning after he was told to come to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you recall, Mr. Truly, whether you hired any personnel for
work in this particular building, in the School Depository, after the 15th of
October and before the 22d of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I don't recall hiring anyone else other than Oswald
for that building the same day that I hired Oswald. I believe, if I am not
mistaken, I hired another boy for a temporary job, and put him in the other
warehouse at 1917 North Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At a different warehouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. At a different warehouse. He was laid off November 15th,
I believe&mdash;November 15th, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What I was getting at is whether an accomplice could have
gotten in in that way. That is why I was asking the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I don't recall. Actually, the end of our fall rush&mdash;if
it hadn't existed a week or 2 weeks longer, or if we had not been using
some of our regular boys putting down this plywood, we would not have had
any need for Lee Oswald at that time, which is a tragic thing for me to think
about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Mr. Truly, while Oswald was in your employ, did you have
any inquiries made of you by any of the United States agencies, such as
FBI, regarding him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; nothing ever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did Oswald mention to you anything about his trip to Russia
and return from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; he did not. He just told me that he just recently was
discharged from the Marines with an honorable discharge. And I suppose
that if he had had some background of a few jobs, skipping here and there,
I might have investigated those jobs thoroughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He did not tell you about those short-time jobs he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No. The thing is I thought he was just discharged from the
service, and we have worked with boys in the past, and they have gone on
and got on their feet and got a better job. And I did not give it a thought
that he was really just not discharged from the Marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Truly, you mentioned the fact that you thought Jack Dougherty
was the one operating that west elevator. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you tell us a little bit about Jack Dougherty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Jack Dougherty has been working for us 12 or 14 years. Until
we moved into this building, he has been mostly in our State Department, the
building at 1917 North Houston. He would fill orders for&mdash;that called for
many cartons of books on a three-textbook-order basis to the various schools in
Texas. And he seemed to be intelligent and smart and a hard worker. The
main thing is he just worked all the time.</p>

<p>I have never had any occasion to have any hard words for Jack. A few
times he would get a little bit&mdash;maybe do a little something wrong, and I
would mention it to him, and he would just go to pieces&mdash;not anything&mdash;but
anything the rest of the day or the next day would not be right. [Deletion.]
He is a great big husky fellow. I think he is 39 years old. He has never
been married. He has no interest in women. He gets flustered, has a small
word for it, at times. He has never had any trouble. He is a good, loyal,
hard working employee. He always has been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you consider him of average intelligence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir. I think what is wrong with him mostly is his emotional
makeup. I would say that for the work he is doing, he is of average
intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got to the fifth floor, as I understand it, the west
elevator was not there, but when you started up from the first floor, you
thought it was on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No. When I came down from the second floor&mdash;from the seventh
floor with the officer, I thought I saw Jack Dougherty on the fifth floor, which
he would have had plenty of time to move the elevator down and up and get
some stock and come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But when you got to the fifth floor that west elevator was not
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it on any floor below the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I didn't look.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you were climbing up the floors, you did not see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And if it wasn't on the fifth floor when you got there, it could
have been on the sixth or seventh, I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I don't believe so, because I think I would have heard
or seen it coming downstairs when I got on the fifth floor elevator, on the
east side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, suppose it was just stopped on the sixth floor when you got
on the fifth floor elevator. Would you have seen it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I think so, yes, sir. As we started up from the fifth floor, you
could see the top of it at an angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you looking in that direction as you rode up on the fifth
floor, or were you facing the east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. I don't know which way I was looking. I was only
intent on getting to the seventh floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you cannot say when you passed the sixth floor whether or
not an elevator was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I cannot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got to the seventh floor, you got out of the east elevator.
Was the west elevator on the seventh floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you sure it was not on the seventh floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear the west elevator running at any time when you
were riding the elevator from the fifth to the seventh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I was not aware of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Any other questions?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How many employees do you have in the building on
the corner of Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I cannot tell you the figures, the total number of the office and
all employees. We had about 15, I think. We had 19-warehouse and order-filler
boys in both warehouses, and there are only four or five down at the other
place. I think we had 15 men working in our warehouse at Houston and Elm
on that day.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. On November 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would all of them normally have had access to the sixth floor,
or might have gone to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Possibly any&mdash;possibly so. We have one man that checks. He
hardly fills any orders. And we have one or two that write up freight. But
any of the order-fillers there might be a possibility&mdash;there might be a possibility
they might need something off the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you noticed the police assembling the employees
after the assassination, what prompted you to think that Oswald was not
among them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I have asked myself that many times. I cannot give an answer.
Unless it was the fact that I knew he was on the second floor, I had seen him
10 or 15 minutes, or whatever it was, before that. That might have brought
that boy's name to my mind&mdash;because I was looking over there and he was
the only one I missed at that time that I could think of. Subconsciously it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
might have been because I saw him on the second floor and I knew he was in
the building.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Had there been any traits that you had noticed from
the time of his employment that might have made you think then that there
was a connection between the shooting and Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Not at all. In fact, I was fooled so completely by the sound of&mdash;the
direction of the shot, that I did not believe&mdash;still did not believe&mdash;maybe I
could not force myself to believe, that the shots came from that building until
I learned that they found the gun and the shells there. So I had no feeling
whatever that they did come from there. I am sure that did not bring Oswald
in my mind. But it was just the fact that they were trying to get people's
names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When you reported that Oswald was missing, do you recall
whether you told the police that he had been on the second floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I just said, "I have a man that is missing. I don't know
whether it means anything, but this is the name."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you know about what time that was that you told
the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I could be wrong, but I think it was around 15&mdash;between 15
minutes or 20 minutes after the shots, or something. I could be as far off as
5 minutes or so. I don't know. I did not seem to think it was very long. We
might have spent more time up on the roof and coming down, and then I might
have walked out in the shipping department. Everybody was running up
asking questions. Time could fool me. But I did not think it was but about
15 or 20 minutes later.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In your description of Oswald to Captain Fritz, did
you describe the kind of clothes that Oswald had on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I don't know, sir. No, sir; I just told him his name and where
he lived and his telephone number and his age, as 23, and I said 5 feet, 9, about
150 pounds, light brown hair&mdash;whatever I picked up off the description there.
I did not try to depend on my memory to describe him. I just put down what
was on this application blank. That's the reason I called Mr. Aiken, because
I did not want to mislead anybody as to a description. I might call a man
brown-haired, and he might be blonde.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When you and the officer saw Oswald in the luncheon room,
did any words pass between you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No. The officer said something to the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I mean between you and Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. Oswald never said a word. Not to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was he doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. He was just standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he have a coke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No drink?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No drink at all. Just standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Anything about his appearance that was startling or unusual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. No, sir; I didn't see him panting like he had been
running or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Didn't appear to be doing anything special, moving in any
direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. He was standing still facing the doorway to the lunchroom.
The officer was there with a gun pointed at him, around towards his
middle, almost touching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How long before the President's actual visit on the 22d of
November did you know of the visit and of the route that he was going to take.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Well, I think they said it was announced 72 hours before
the assassination that he would take that route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was there any discussion, as far as you know, among your
employees, of the fact that the procession would go near the School Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; not that I know of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you ever have any reason to suspect any other member&mdash;any
other of your boys of being in any way connected with this affair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I never have found anything or any actions to make
me feel that they might be connected with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You never observed Oswald conversing with any strange or
unidentified characters during his employment with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did Oswald have any visitors as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Never knew of a one; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did he have the use of a telephone when he was in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir. We have a telephone on the first floor that he was
free to use during his lunch hour for a minute. He was supposed to ask permission
to use the phone. But he could have used the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Pay telephone or office telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; it is a regular office telephone. It is a pushbutton type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did he strike you as being a frequent user of that telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I never remember ever seeing him on the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you have any record or be able to find out now whether he
had ever used it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You did not see him on November 22d with any package or any
bundle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Truly, when we were there on March 20th, did you take a
walk down from the southeast corner window on the sixth floor with Officer
Baker and a Secret Service Agent Howlett&mdash;we walked along from that window
at the southeast corner of the sixth floor, walked along the east wall to the
northeast corner of the building, and then across there around the elevators,
and Secret Service Agent Howlett simulated putting a rifle at the spot where
the rifle was found; and then we took the stairs down to the second floor lunchroom
where Officer Baker encountered Lee Harvey Oswald? You remember us
doing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How fast were we going&mdash;running, trotting, walking or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Walking at a brisk walk, and then a little bit faster, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You remember what time that was? How long did it take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. It seemed to me like it was a minute and 18 seconds, and a
minute and 15 seconds. We tried it twice. I believe that is about as near as
I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If a person were in that southeast corner window, just knowing
the way the books were laid up there, would that have been the most practicable
route to use to get out of there, to get down the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I believe so. I believe it to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. In your judgment, you think that is the route that Oswald took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I think&mdash;he had two possible routes there. One of them, he
could come half way down the east wall and down this way, but he would
have to make one more turn. But if he came all the way down the east wall
to where the rows of books stop, he had a straight run toward the sixth floor
stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You do not think he used any of the elevators at any time to
get from the sixth to the second floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. You mean after the shooting? No, sir; he just could not, because
those elevators, I saw myself, were both on the fifth floor, they were both even.
And I tried to get one of them, and then when we ran up to the second floor&mdash;it
would have been impossible for him to have come down either one of those
elevators after the assassination. He had to use the stairway as his only way
of getting down&mdash;since we did see the elevators in those positions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He could not have taken it down and then have somebody
else go up to that floor and leave it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir; I don't believe he would have had time for that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He couldn't have taken an elevator down and then
sent it up to a higher floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. Yes; he could. I suppose he could put his hand through
the slotted bars and touched one of the upper floors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On both elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. That is just the west one only.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That was feasible, even though it might be a little
difficult?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was no button on the outside that permitted him
to send an elevator up to a higher floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. It would take him quite a little job to get his hand
all through there and press one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would he have to break any glass to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir. The car gate&mdash;and then there was an outside gate
slatted&mdash;slats about this far apart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you entered the building with the officer behind you,
when you were presumably trying to get to the roof, there had been no cordon
at that time thrown around the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. So that Oswald could have slipped out without an officer having
been at the doorway at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir; I think so. There were many officers running down
west of the building. It appears many people thought the shots came from
there because of the echo or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is it your view he went out the front door rather than one of
the back doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir; it is. From the nature&mdash;from the direction he was
walking through the office, and the front stairway, to reach the second floor&mdash;it
is my view that he walked down the front stairs and just out through the
crowd there, probably a minute or two before the police had everything stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. From what you know of these young men who testified before
you today, are they trustworthy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. Yes, sir; I think they are. They are good men. They have
been with me, most of them, for some time. I have no reason to doubt their
word. I do know that they have been rather, as the expression goes, shook
up about this thing, especially this tall one, Bonnie Williams. He is pretty
superstitious, I would say. For 2 or 3 weeks the work was not normal, or a
month. The boys did not put out their normal amount of work. Their hearts
were not in it. But after that, they have picked up very well. They are doing
their work well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If we can go off the record for just a moment.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Truly</span>. I thank you very much.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you, sir. You have helped us a good deal.</p>

<p>We will recess at this time until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 6 p.m. the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<h2 id="mlb">TESTIMONY OF MARRION L. BAKER</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Would you raise your right hand and be sworn please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission will
be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I do, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be seated. I will read a little short brief statement
to you, Mr. Baker, which will indicate the purpose of our meeting today.</p>

<p>The purpose of today's hearing is to hear the testimony of M.&nbsp;L. Baker, Mrs.
R.&nbsp;A. Reid, Eugene Boone, Luke Mooney, and M.&nbsp;N. McDonald. Officer Baker
and Mrs. Reid were in the vicinity of the Texas School Book Depository Building

of the Texas School Depository Building shortly after the assassination and
Officer McDonald apprehended Lee Harvey Oswald at the Texas theater.</p>

<p>I read this to you just so you will know the general nature of the inquiry
we are making today and we will make of you.</p>

<p>Mr. Belin will conduct the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, would you state your legal name, please for the
Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Marrion L. Baker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are known as M. L. Baker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. With Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Almost 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you, Officer Baker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Thirty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. In a little town called Blum, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to school in Blum, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I think I went to about the sixth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We moved to Dallas and I continued schooling at the Roger Q.
Mills School, elementary, went to junior high school, I believe it was called
Storey, and then I finished high school in Adamson High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after you graduated from high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I think I got married.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Gentlemen, at this time I must go to the court, we have a
session of the court today hearing arguments and Mr. Dulles, you are going
to be here through the morning, so if you will conduct the meeting from this
time on.</p>

<p>Excuse me, gentlemen.</p>

<p>(At this point, the Chief Justice left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you got married, sir, what did you do. I mean in the
way of vocation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I took up a job as a sheetmetal man at the Continental Tin Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you work for Continental?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Approximately 3 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At that time I quit this job and went to the Ford Motor Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do at Ford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, at that time I stayed there approximately 11 months and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
they laid me off and I went to the, I believe they call it Chance Vought at that
time, aircraft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do at Ford, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I was a glass installer, I believe that is what you would call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>When you went to this aircraft factory what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I was a material clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you work for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I didn't understand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you work for the aircraft company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It seemed like somewhere around a year and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At that time it was uncertain out there whether you would stay
there or not, they were laying off a few of the men and I went with the neighbor's
trailer company which was located in Oak Cliff there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I was, I guess you would call it a mechanic. I did a little bit
of everything there, I did all the road work, and did all the delivering at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. A little over 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Then I became, I went with the city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. With the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take a course of instruction for the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I went to the Dallas Police Academy School out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long was this schooling period, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Four months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you were graduated from the Dallas Police Academy, did
you right away become a motorcycle policeman or were you first a patrolman
or what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; at first I was a patrolman and I spent some 23 months
in radio patrol division. And then I volunteered solo division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you were in this radio car, was this a patrol car where two
men would <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And have you been a motorcycle policeman then, say, for the
last 7 or 8 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; that is pretty close to it.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, you use the word solo; generally do people in police
cars ride in pairs during the daytime or solos or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. If you are talking about the squad cars at the time that I
worked in the radio patrol division, most of them were two-men squads.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there some one-man squads, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Very few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about today, do you know what the situation is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. They still have, say, very few two-men squads and a lot of one-man
squads now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They have a lot of one-man squads now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is that because of a shortage of men for the jobs to cover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Not because of the procedures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Now, at night they try to ride them two men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the daytime what is the situation now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Usually the downtown squads which I work are two men, and
the outlying squads are one man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Coming down to November 22, 1963, what was your occupation on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I was assigned to ride a motorcycle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where were you assigned to ride the motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At this particular day in the office up there before we went out,
I was, my partner and I, we received instructions to ride right beside the
President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About when was this that you received these instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Let's see, I believe we went to work early that day, somewhere
around 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And from whom did you receive your original instructions to
ride by the side of the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Our sergeant is the one who gave us the instructions. This is
all made up in the captain's office, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Captain Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Chief Curry; our captain is Captain Lawrence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were these instructions ever changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. When we got to the airport, our sergeant instructed
me that there wouldn't be anybody riding beside the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell you why or why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir. We had several occasions where we were assigned
there and we were moved by request.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On that day, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, that day and several other occasions when I have escorted
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On that day when did you ride or where were you supposed to
ride after this assignment was changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. They just&mdash;the sergeant told us just to fall in beyond it, I believe
he called it the press, behind the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Beyond the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell you this after the President's plane arrived at the airport
or was it before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It seemed like it was after he arrived out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you already seen him get out of the plane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time was it before the motorcade left that you were
advised of this, was it just before or 5 or 10 minutes before, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It was 5 or 10 minutes before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then the motorcade left and you rode along on a motorcycle in the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it a two-wheeler or a three-wheeler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It was a two-wheeler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You rode with the motorcade as it traveled through downtown
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And eventually what is the fact as to whether or not the motorcade
got to Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. You say how fast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No; did the motorcade get to Main Street in Dallas, was it going
down Main Street at anytime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I wonder if you would pick up your actions with the motorcade as it went
down Main Street commencing at, say, Main and Record Streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, it was the usual escort. We were traveling about somewhere
around 5 to 10 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There is a map right behind you.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Back on the record again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you state exactly where you were riding? We know a
good deal about this, the cars the way they were paced. There was a car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
right behind the President's car that followed it, I think 6 or 7 feet right
behind the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That was the Secret Service car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is right. Were you in that gap between the two cars or
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I was, it seemed to me like, there was this car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When you say "this car" what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That Secret Service car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Secret Service car right behind the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And there was one more car in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Behind that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was the Vice President's car, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. There were four press cars carrying the press and I was right at
the side of that last one.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. The last press car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The last press car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So you were roughly how far behind the President's car at this
stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Sometimes we got, at this stage we were possibly a half block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. A half block?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; as I say as I turned the corner the front of it was
turning the corner at Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean as you were turning right from Main on to Houston
Street heading north onto Houston, the President's car had already turned to
the left off Houston heading down that entrance to the expressway, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I believe&mdash;pardon me, Mr. Dulles, does that answer your question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That answers my question. I wanted to see where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You said you were going down Main Street at around Record at
from 5 to 10 miles an hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Will you take up your trip from there, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As we approached the corner there of Main and Houston we were
making a right turn, and as I came out behind that building there, which
is the county courthouse, the sheriff building, well, there was a strong wind
hit me and I almost lost my balance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How fast would you estimate the speed of your motorcycle as
you turned the corner, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I would say&mdash;it wasn't very fast. I almost lost balance, we were
just creeping along real slowly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is turning from Main into Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You turned&mdash;do you have any actual speed estimate as you turned
that corner at all or just you would say very slow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I would say from around 5 to 6 or 7 miles an hour, because you
can't hardly travel under that and you know keep your balance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From what direction was the wind coming when it hit you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Due north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, tell us what happened after you turned on to Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I got myself straightened up there, I guess it took me some
20, 30 feet, something like that, and it was about that time that I heard these
shots come out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Could you just tell us what you heard and what you saw and what you did?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I got, like I say as I got straightened up there, I was, I
don't know when these shots started coming off, I just&mdash;it seemed to me like
they were high, and I just happened to look right straight <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder if you would just tell us on that chart and I will try
to follow with the record where you were at this time, you were coming down
Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sir, if you can&mdash;I plan to get that actual chart in a minute. If
we <span class="locked">could&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I want to see where he was vis-a-vis the building on the chart
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This is Main Street and this is Houston. This is the corner that
I am speaking of; I made the right turn here. The motorcade and all, as I
was here turning the front car was turning up here, and as I got somewhere
about right <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is halfway down the first block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, sir; can I interrupt you for a minute?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, when we were in Dallas on March 20, Friday, you
walked over with me and showed me about the point you thought your motorcycle
was when you heard the first shot, do you remember doing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then we paced this off measuring it from a distance which
could be described as the north curbline of Main Street as extended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; that would be this one right across here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And we paced it off as to where you thought your motorcycle was
when you heard the first shot and do you remember offhand about where you said
this was as to what distance it was, north of the north curbline of Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We approximated it was 60 to 80 feet there, north of the north
curbline of Main on Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does that answer your question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That answers my question entirely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In any event you heard the first shot, or when you heard this
noise did you believe it was a shot or did you believe it was something else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It hit me all at once that it was a rifle shot because I had just
got back from deer hunting and I had heard them pop over there for about a
week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of a weapon did it sound like it was coming from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It sounded to me like it was a high-powered rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. When you heard the first shot or the first noise, what
did you do and what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, to me, it sounded high and I immediately kind of looked
up, and I had a feeling that it came from the building, either right in front of
me or of the one across to the right of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What would the building right in front of you be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It would be this Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be the building located on what corner of Houston
and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That would be the northwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. And you thought it was either from that building or the
building located where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. On the northeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Did you see or hear or do anything else after you
heard the first noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. As I was looking up, all these pigeons began to fly
up to the top of the buildings here and I saw those come up and start flying
around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From what building, if you know, do you think those pigeons
came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I wasn't sure, but I am pretty sure they came from the building
right on the northwest corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see or do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, I immediately revved that motorcycle up and was going
up there to see if I could help anybody or see what was going on because I
couldn't see around this bend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, between the time you revved up the motorcycle had you
heard any more shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I heard&mdash;now before I revved up this motorcycle, I
heard the, you know, the two extra shots, the three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any time estimate as to the spacing of any of these
shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It seemed to me like they just went bang, bang, bang; they were
pretty well even to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They were pretty well even.</p>

<p>Anything else between the time of the first shot and the time of the last shot
that you did up to the time or <span class="locked">saw&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; except I was looking up and I could tell it was high
and I was looking up there and I saw those pigeons flying around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice anything in either of those two buildings either
on the northeast or northwest corner of Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you looking at any of those windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I kind of glanced over them, but I couldn't see anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. After the third shot, then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, I revved that motorcycle up and I went down to the corner
which would be approximately 180 to 200 feet from the point where we had
first stated, you know, that we heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What distance did you state? What we did on Friday afternoon,
we paced off from the point you thought you heard the first shot to the
point at which you parked the motorcycle, and this paced off to how much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. From 180 to 200 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is where you parked the motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I wonder if we could go on this plat, Officer Baker, and first if you could put
on here with this pen, and I have turned it upside down.</p>

<p>With Exhibit 361, show us the spot at which you stopped your motorcycle
approximately and put a "B" on it, if you would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Somewhere at this position here, which is approximately 10 feet
from this signal light here on the northwest corner of Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You have put a dot on Exhibit 361 with the line going to "B" and the dot
represents that signal light, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You, on Friday, March 20, parked your motorcycle where you
thought it was parked on November 22 and then we paced off the distance from
the nearest point of the motorcycle to the stop light and it was 10 feet, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, I show you Exhibit 478 and ask you if you will, on this exhibit put an
arrow with the letter "B" to this stoplight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Talking about this one here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The stoplight from which we measured the distance to the motorcycle.
The arrow with the letter "B" points to the stoplight, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you stopped your motorcycle 10 feet to the east of that stoplight,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We then paced off the distance as to approximately how far it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
was from the place your motorcycle was parked to the doorway of the School
Book Depository Building, do you remember doing that, on March 20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And it appears on Exhibit 477 that that doorway is recessed, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how far that was from the place your motorcycle
was parked to the doorway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Approximately 45 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This same stoplight appears as you look at Exhibit 477 to the
left of the entranceway to the building, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you parked your motorcycle, did you notice anything that
was going on in the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. As I parked <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing on Exhibit 361 to the place that you have marked
with "B."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And I was looking westward which would be in this direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By that, you are pointing down the entrance to the freeway and
kind of what I will call the peninsula of the park there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Toward the triple underpass.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Where is the underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. The underpass is down here. This is really Elm Street, and
this would be Main and Commerce and they all come together here, and there
is a triple overpass.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At this point, I looked down here as I was parking my motorcycle
and these people on this ground here, on the sidewalk, there were several
of them falling, and they were rolling around down there, and all these people
were rushing back, a lot of them were grabbing their children, and I noticed
one, I didn't know who he was, but there was a man ran out into the crowd
and back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Except there was a woman standing&mdash;well, all these people were
running, and there was a woman screaming, "Oh, they have shot that man,
they have shot that man."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, you are on Exhibit 361, and you are pointing to people along the area
or bordering the entrance to that expressway and that bit of land lying to the
west and north, as to where you describe these people, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you mark where the overpass would be, right at the
end of those lines, just so we get oriented on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am trying to see down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I just wanted to get a general idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Exhibit 361, sir, it wouldn't show but it basically would be
off in this direction coming down this way. The entrance to the freeway would
go down here and the overpass would roughly be down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As far as that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir; I think Mr. Redlich is going to get a picture that will
better describe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Is there anything else you saw there, Officer Baker, before you ran to the
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what did you do after surveying the situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I had it in mind that the shots came from the top of this building
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By this building, you are referring to what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. The Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go on.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You were parked right in front of the Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; ran right straight to it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Let me ask you a question. How far away, approximately, were these people
who were running and falling and so forth from the entrance to the Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, now, let me say this. From this position here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is position "B" on Exhibit 361?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. There were people running all over this here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you are pointing to the street and the parkway all in front
of the School Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. You see, it looked to me like there were maybe 500 or 600 people in
this area here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As those shots rang out, why they started running, you know,
every direction, just trying to get back out of the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. For the record, by this area right here, you have that little
peninsula between the Elm Street extension and the Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right. This little street runs down in front of the building
down here to the property of the railroad tracks and this is all a parkway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes. I just wanted to get it for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then ran into the Building, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see and what did you do as you ran into the
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I entered this building, there was, it seems to me like there
was outside doors and then there is a little lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And then there are some inner doors and another door you have
to go through, a swinging door type.</p>

<p>As I entered this lobby there were people going in as I entered. And I
asked, I just spoke out and asked where the stairs or elevator was, and this
man, Mr. Truly, spoke up and says, it seems to me like he says, "I am a building
manager. Follow me, officer, and I will show you." So we immediately went
out through the second set of doors, and we ran into the swinging door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, during the course of running into the swinging door, did you bump into
the back of Mr. Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We finally backed up and got through that little swinging door
there and we kind of all ran, not real fast but, you know, a good trot, to the
back of the Building, I was following him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We went to the northwest corner, we was kind of on the, I
would say, the southeast corner of the Building there where we entered it, and
we went across it to the northwest corner which is in the rear, back there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And he was trying to get that service elevator down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. What did you see Mr. Truly do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He ran over there and pushed the button to get it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the elevator come down after he pushed the button?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; it didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He hollered for it, said, "Bring that elevator down here."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many times did he holler, to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It seemed like he did it twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I said let's take the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He said, "Okay" and so he immediately turned around, which
the stairs is just to the, would be to the, well, the west of this elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And we went up them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went up the stairs then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you started up the stairs what was your intention at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. My intention was to go all the way to the top where I thought the
shots had come from, to see if I could find something there, you know, to
indicate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And did you go all the way up to the top of the stairs right away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; we didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I came out to the second floor there, Mr. Truly was ahead of
me, and as I come out I was kind of scanning, you know, the rooms, and I caught
a glimpse of this man walking away from this&mdash;I happened to see him through
this window in this door. I don't know how come I saw him, but I had a
glimpse of him coming down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where was he coming from, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir. All I seen of him was a glimpse of him go away from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I ran on over <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You mean where he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. There is a door there with a glass, it seemed to me
like about a 2 by 2, something like that, and then there is another door which
is 6 foot on over there, and there is a hallway over there and a hallway entering
into a lunchroom, and when I got to where I could see him he was walking away
from me about 20 feet away from me in the lunchroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I hollered at him at that time and said, "Come here." He
turned and walked right straight back to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you at the time you hollered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I was standing in the hallway between this door and the second
door, right at the edge of the second door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He walked back toward you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you what has been marked Commission Exhibit 497 which
appears to be a diagram of the second floor of the School Book Depository, and
you will notice on this diagram there are circles with arrows. I want you to
state, if you will, what number or the arrow approximates the point at which you
were standing when you told him to "Come here". Is there a number on there
at all or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This 24 would be the position where I was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The arrow which is represented by No. 24, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Exhibit 497. When you first saw him in which direction was
he walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He was walking east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was&mdash;his back was away from you, or not, as you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I first caught that glimpse of him, or as I saw him, really
saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you really saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He was walking away from me with his back toward me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Can I suggest if you will do this, put on there where the officer
was and where Lee Oswald was, or the man who turned out to be Lee Oswald,
and which direction he was walking in. I think that is quite important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir. We are going to get to that with one more question, if
I can, sir. When you saw him, he then turned around, is that correct, and then
walked back toward you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he carrying anything in his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He had nothing at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Were you carrying anything in either of your hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were you carrying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I had my revolver out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you take your revolver out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I was starting up the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, turning to Exhibit 497, if you would approximate
on Exhibit 497 with a pen the point at which you saw this man in the lunch
room when you told him to turn around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could we get first where he first saw him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You have that already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I don't think you have it on the chart where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is when he first saw him after he got in the room, sir. If I
can go off the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What I wanted to get is where he first saw him as he was standing
down here, as he was going up the stairs and stopped and then in what direction
he was&mdash;he seemed to be moving at that time before he saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Just answer the question, if you will. Where were you when
you first caught a glimpse of this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I was just coming up these stairs just around this corner right
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You were coming up the stairs at the point on Exhibit
497 where there are the letters "DN" marking down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you saw something move through a door which is marked
as what number on Exhibit 497?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where was he when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At this doorway right here, this 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At 23.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. May I ask a couple of questions because I have to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Were you suspicious of this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And he came up to you, did he say anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Let me start over. I assumed that I was suspicious of everybody
because I had my pistol out.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And as soon as I saw him, I caught a glimpse of him and I ran
over there and opened that door and hollered at him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He had not seen you up to that point probably?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I don't know whether he had or not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. He came up to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; and when I hollered at him he turned around and
walked back to me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Right close to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And we were right here at this position 24, right here in this
doorway.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Right. What did you say to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I didn't get anything out of him. Mr. Truly had come up to
my side here, and I turned to Mr. Truly and I says, "Do you know this man,
does he work here?" And he said yes, and I turned immediately and went
on out up the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you continued up the stairway?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Let me ask one other question. You later, when you
recognized this man as Lee Oswald, is that right, saw pictures of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. I had occasion to see him in the homicide office later
that evening after we got through with Parkland Hospital and then Love
Field and we went back to the City Hall and I went up there and made this
affidavit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. After he had been arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you tell us anything more about his appearance, what
he was doing, get an impression of the man at all? Did he seem to be hurrying,
anything of that kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Evidently he was hurrying because at this point here, I was
running, and I ran on over here to this door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What door number on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This would be 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And at that position there he was already down here some 20
feet away from me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. When you saw him, was he out of breath, did he appear
to have been running or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It didn't appear that to me. He appeared normal you know.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was he calm and collected?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. He never did say a word or nothing. In fact, he didn't
change his expression one bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he flinch in anyway when you put the gun up in his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There is no testimony that he put the gun up in his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I had my gun talking to him like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How close was your gun to him if it wasn't the face whatever
part of the body it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. About as far from me to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be about how far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Approximately 3 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice, did he say anything or was there any expression
after Mr. Truly said he worked here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At that time I never did look back toward him. After he says,
"Yes, he works here," I turned immediately and run on up, I halfway turned
then when I was talking to Mr. Truly.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That question about time I would like to establish.</p>

<p>How long would you say it was from the time that you first heard the shots
until that episode occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We went back and made two trial runs on that, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that on Friday, March 20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And the first run we made it was a minute and 30 seconds,
<span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Will you say from what time to what time, from the last shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. From the last shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. The first shot.</p>

<p>We simulated the shots and by the time we got there, we did everything
that I did that day, and this would be the minimum, because I am sure that I,
you know, it took me a little longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I want to get clear in my mind and for the record, it started
at the first shot and when did it terminate, when you saw Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. When we saw Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When you saw Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And that time is how much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. The first run would be a minute and 30 seconds, and then we
did it over, and we did it in a minute and 15 seconds.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Boggs left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were we walking or running when we did this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. The first time we did it a little bit slower, and the second time
we hurried it up a little bit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were we running or walking, when we moved, did we run or
walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. From the time I got off the motorcycle we walked the first time
and then we kind of run the second time from the motorcycle on into the
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. When we got inside the building did we run or trot
or walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, we did it at kind of a trot, I would say, it wasn't a real
fast run, an open run. It was more of a trot, kind of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mentioned the relationship between what we did on March 20
and what actually occurred on November 22. Would you estimate that what
we did on March 20 was the maximum or the minimum as for the time you
took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I would say it would be the minimum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For instance, on March 20 did we do anything about trying to get
through any people on the front steps of the building at all? Did we slow down
at all for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did we slow down at all on March 20 for the time it took you
to look over the scene as to what was happening in the area down Elm Street
and the Parkway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Later did we go to the southeast corner of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. With the stopwatch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did we make any or do any stopwatch tests about any route
from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down to the lunchroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; we made two test runs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Do you remember what the route was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; we started on the sixth floor on the east side of the
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We walked down the east wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We started at that particular corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; we started in the southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. We walked down the east wall, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then where did we go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. To the north wall and then we walked down the north wall
to the west side of where the stairs was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, we walked from the southeast corner to the northeast
corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then along the northeast corner, around the elevators, do you
remember who was with us when we did this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. There was, it seems to me like his name was John&mdash;anyway,
he was a Secret Service man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. John Howlett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. John Howlett. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Mr. Howlett simulate anyone putting a gun in any particular
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what did we do when we got to the&mdash;where did he do
that, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That would be as we approached the stairway, there were some
cases of books on the left-hand side there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. And Secret Service Agent Howlett went over to these
books and leaned over as if he were putting a rifle there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Then we continued on down the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To the lunchroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how long that took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. The first run with normal walking took us a minute and 18
seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the second time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And the second time we did it at a fast walk which took us a
minute and 14 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw the stopwatch on all of these timing occasions when
it was started and when it was stopped, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I want to go back to the sixth floor a minute with Mr.
Dulles' questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Can we go off the record here one moment?</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the record.</p>

<p>Officer Baker, when you related your story earlier you said that as you ran
back on the first floor you first ran to the elevator shaft, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you stopped at the east or the west elevator door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That would be the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. This was on the first floor, and did you look up the
elevator shaft at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; at that time I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This was while Mr. Truly was calling for the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any kind of a gate between you and the elevator shaft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Wood or metal, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It is wood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see when you looked up the elevator shaft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At that time I thought there was just one elevator there, you know,
one big freight elevator, and to me they looked like they were up there, I didn't
know how many floors in that building but you could see them up there, it looked
like just at that time, I thought it was just one, when I looked up there, and
it looked to me anywhere from three to four floors up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was either elevator moving at the time or&mdash;pardon me, was there
any elevator moving at the time you saw and looked up the shaft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear any elevator moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Truly pushed the button, I believe you said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he pushed the button did any elevator start moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you looked up the elevator shaft did it appear as if there
was one elevator covering the complete shaft or did it appear there was one
elevator that you saw covering half of the shaft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Like I say, I thought it was one elevator there and it was covering
the whole deal up there so to me it appeared to be one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It didn't appear to be two elevators on different floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, you got up to floor number two at the time and
you did that with the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At the time you got up there was there any elevator on floor
number two that you can remember, if you can remember? Maybe you cannot
remember, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Evidently&mdash;now, I didn't look, evidently it wasn't because it
seemed to me like the next floor up Mr. Truly said let's take the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At some higher floor after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, if we can go off the record for a moment here.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, first of all, handing you what the court reporter has
marked as Exhibit 498, I would like you to state if you know whether or not this
appears to be the door leading from the second floor hallway into the vestibule
going into the lunchroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is this the door through which you glanced as you came around the
stairs coming up from the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see that caused you to turn away from going up to
the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I came out of that stairway running, Mr. Truly had already
gone on around, see, and I don't know, as I come <span class="locked">around&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Gone on around and up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He had already started around the bend to come to the next elevation
going up, I was coming out this one on the second floor, and I don't know,
I was kind of sweeping this area as I come up, I was looking from right to left
and as I got to this door here I caught a glimpse of this man, just, you know, a
sudden glimpse, that is all it was now, and it looked to me like he was going away
from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I ran on up here and opened this door and when I got this door
opened I could see him walking on down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Had he meanwhile gone on through the door ahead of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I can't say whether he had gone on through that door or not. All
I did was catch a glance at him, and evidently he was&mdash;this door might have been,
you know, closing and almost shut at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing by "this door" to the door on Exhibit 498?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You mean you might have seen him as he was opening and going
through the door almost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, to me it was the back of it. Now, through this window you
can't see too much but I just caught a glimpse of him through this window
going away from me and as I ran to this door and opened it, and looked on
down in the lunchroom he was on down there about 20 feet so he was moving
about as fast as I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How far were you as you left the stairwell, the <span class="locked">stairway&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. From that door through which you eventually went through
and then saw Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I would say that was approximately 15, 20 feet, something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. On Exhibit 499 is this a picture of the lunchroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what direction the camera is pointing to take this
picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It would be pointed eastward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. I see a coke machine off on the left. When you saw
Oswald after you got to this doorway inside the lunchroom, had he gone as far
as the coke machine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I didn't notice the coke machine or any item in the room there.
All I was looking at was the man, and he seemed to be approximately 20 feet
down there from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you got to the doorway which on Exhibit 497 is marked as
number, what number is that, you are referring to this number 24 here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, with relation to Exhibit 497 perhaps you can try to trace
your route as you came out from the stairway, as to the route you took and the
point you were when you first caught a glimpse of some movement through
that window or door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At the upper portion of this stairway leading to the second floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
I was just stepping out on to the second floor when I caught this glimpse of this
man through this doorway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to put a spot there, with the letter "B" at the point
you believe you were when you were looking through that door? You put the
letter "B" on Exhibit 497 when you first saw the movement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you, from that point, could you kind of trace your route
to <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question before you ask this question, and this
is a bit of a leading question, and think carefully.</p>

<p>If Oswald had been coming down the stairs and going into the lunchroom
would he have been following the course insofar as you saw a course, that he&mdash;that
you saw him follow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. The reason I say that, this hallway to the <span class="locked">right&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the right you mean the hallway that goes to the&mdash;this <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This is a hallway right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It is a hallway that has the number 27 on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; from what I understand these are offices in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And he had no business in there and the lunchroom would be the
only place that he would be going, and there is a door out here that you can get
out and to the other part of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think Mr. Dulles' question relates to whether or not any person
would have taken a stairway or elevator to have gotten to that point, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes; that is correct. I am clear as you come up the stairs you
take a certain course you would go into the lunchroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am not quite clear as to where you would end up on the second
floor as you come down the stairs, is it the same point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Dulles, if you will look on Exhibit 497, the stairway appears
to be the same stairway. You see the letter, the arrow, 21, points to the stairway
going up to the third floor which, of course, would be the same stairway
going down from the third floor and on the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You would cross if you were going up and down, you would
cross right there at the same point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And if a man were going up the stairs and then going to the
lunchroom and then coming down the stairs and going to the lunchroom, he
would be approximately following the same course from the time he got off the
stairs and went into that room before you get to the lunchroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, you had just marked on Exhibit 497 point "B"
where you thought you were at about the time you caught a glimpse of something,
either through a door or through the window in the door marked 23, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you trace your route from point "B" to the doorway 23, if
you would, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I ran right straight across here and through this doorway and
this is approximately where, I would say 23 here, is approximately where I
looked through this lunchroom and saw a man on down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. I am going to put an arrow at that point on Exhibit 497,
and this arrow in pen, I am going to put a "B-1" and at that arrow which
is just to the left of the circle with the number 24 in it you say you then looked
through the doorway and saw a man in the lunchroom, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; walking away from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Walking away from you. And then where did you move from
point "B-1"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I moved on to this position 24 right here in this doorway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. I am going to put&mdash;you have put an "X" there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
I am going to put that on Exhibit 497 as an arrow pointing to it, with "B-2".
Is this where you stood when you called to the man to come back to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you move from that time until the man came up to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I called, I remember moving forward a little bit and meeting
him right here in this doorway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you called you say you remembered moving forward and
meeting him right in the doorway which would be marked with the arrow with
number 24 on it on Exhibit 497, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you got there, did you move until the man came up to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice what clothes the man was wearing as he came
up to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At that particular time I was looking at his face, and it seemed
to me like he had a light brown jacket on and maybe some kind of white-looking
shirt.</p>

<p>Anyway, as I noticed him walking away from me, it was kind of dim in there
that particular day, and it was hanging out to his side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you what has been marked as Commission Exhibit 150,
would this appear to be anything that you have ever seen before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I believe that is the shirt that he had on when he came&mdash;I
wouldn't be sure of that. It seemed to me like that other shirt was a little
bit darker than that whenever I saw him in the homicide office there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about when you saw him in the School Book Depository
Building, does this look familiar as anything he was wearing, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I couldn't say whether that was&mdash;it seemed to me it was a light-colored
brown but I couldn't say it was that or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Lighter brown did you say, I am just asking what you said. I
couldn't quite hear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; all I can remember it was in my recollection of it it was
a light brown jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you referring to this Exhibit 150 as being similar to the
jacket or similar to the shirt that you saw or, if not, similar to either one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, it would be similar in color to it&mdash;I assume it was a jacket,
it was hanging out. Now, I was looking at his face and I wasn't really paying
any attention. After Mr. Truly said he knew him, so I didn't pay any attention
to him, so I just turned and went on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you did see him later at the police station, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he wearing anything that looked like Exhibit 150 at the
police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He did have a brown-type shirt on that was out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it appear to be similar to any clothing you had seen when
you saw him at the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I could have mistaken it for a jacket, but to my recollection it
was a little colored jacket, that is all I can say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You saw Oswald later in the lineup or <span class="locked">later&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I never did have a chance to see him in the lineup. I saw him
when I went to give the affidavit, the statement that I saw him down there,
of the actions of myself and Mr. Truly as we went into the building and on up
what we are discussing now.</p>

<p>(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer <span class="locked">Baker&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I didn't get clearly in mind, I am trying to check up, as to whether
you saw Oswald maybe in the same costume later in the day. Did you see
Oswald later in the day of November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Under what circumstances? Don't go into detail, I just want
to tie up these two situations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I was in the homicide office there writing this, giving this
affidavit, I got hung in one of those little small offices back there, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Secret Service took Mr. Oswald in there and questioned him and I couldn't get
out by him while they were questioning him, and I did get to see him at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You saw him for a moment at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, you then left the second floor lunchroom with
Mr. Truly, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay in the lunchroom after Truly identified
this person as being an employee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Just momentarily. As he said, "Yes, he works here," I turned and
went on up the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Do you have any time estimate as to the period of
time that elapsed between the time that you first got to the head of the stairs
and saw some movement through that first doorway and the time you left to
go back up to the flight of stairs going to the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I would say approximately maybe 30 seconds, something like
that. It was a real quick interview, you know, and then I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. As you left, did you notice whether or not the man
in the lunchroom did anything or started moving anywhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir. As I left he was still in the position that he was whenever
I was facing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then went where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I immediately turned and went on, started on, up the stairways.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. After going up the stairways, do you know what numbered
floor it was&mdash;I will ask you this, did you take the stairway all the way
to the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; we caught that elevator, it seemed like we went up either
one or two floors, and Mr. Truly said "Let's take the elevator, here it is."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take an east or west elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We took the east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, the nearest elevator to you when you got off a flight of
stairs would have been the east or the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. The west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got off the flight of stairs Mr. Truly said, "Here is an
elevator," did the west elevator appear to be there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I didn't notice. I was looking around over the building at the
time he said, "Let's take the elevator" and I just followed him on around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went to an east elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did it appear you rode up the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It was a short ride. We just, either went one or two floors.
I couldn't remember. I was still looking at the floors, you know, as we went up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you rode up on the elevator, did you notice whether or not
you passed the elevator on the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I didn't notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice or hear anything to indicate that the elevator on
the west side might have been moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take the east elevator as far as it would go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We had to walk up another flight of stairs to get up to the top
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To get up to the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got off on the seventh floor or the top <span class="locked">floor&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice whether or not the other elevator was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't notice. You got off the east elevator and then what
did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We walked up the flight of stairs to the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To the top. What did you do when you got to the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We went out on the roof.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do on the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I immediately went around all the sides of the ledges up there,
and after I got on top I found out that a person couldn't shoot off that roof
because when you stand up you have to put your hands like this, at the top of
that ledge and if you wanted to see over you would have to tiptoe to see over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. If you look right behind you, Officer, you will see a picture and
you might point out what the top wall that is shown on that photograph of the
building is how high?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, it is about 5 feet. I know I had to put my hand on top
of it and tiptoe to see over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Mr. Dulles is referring to the picture of the School
Book Depository building on Exhibit 362 and in demonstrating before the Commission
as to where your hands were about how high are they in relation to
your shoulders or mouth or chin or what-have-you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Approximately 5 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your hands are 5 feet high? Did you go over just to one roof side
or to all sides of the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; we came out at this northwest corner back behind this
sign here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And then I ran, kind of running walk, went all the way around.
First I glanced over this side here, because the last thing I heard here on the
radio was the chief saying, "Get some men up on that railroad track."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear that on your police radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; that was the last thing I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you were getting off your motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I didn't hear what he said he heard on the radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I heard Chief Curry, the chief of the police over there, say,
"Get some men over on the railroad track." I think everyone at that time
thought these shots came from the railroad track.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By "everyone" do you include you, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir. I had it&mdash;I was in a better position due to the wind and
you know under it, that I knew it was directly ahead, and up, and it either had
to be this building here or this one over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to either the first building, you are pointing
to the School Book Depository Building, and the second one you are pointing to
is the one across the street. When you heard this announcement on your radio
was it while you were parking your motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go ahead, if you would, please. You are on the roof now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, as I looked over here, all these people, there were people all
over this railroad track.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are saying as you are looking over the south and over the
west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Then after I looked to see what was going on down there, and
then I figured out that he wouldn't have shot from that ledge he would have shot
from this sign or this old room, building back here on the back side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, you are pointing to Exhibit 362 to the sign on
the top of the School Book Depository Building, the Hertz sign, and some kind of
a structure on the northeast corner of the building, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, when you talk, I wonder if you would look at me,
we might be able to hear a little bit better. Would you tell us what else you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I finished going all around this building here and then I
came to this sign and I looked up there to see if I could find anybody hiding up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
there and I started up these steps, it is a ladder there on that sign, and I got
on, say, 10 feet up there and I came back down, I seen that nobody would
shoot from up there. He wouldn't have no place to hold on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By that you are referring to climbing the ladder to climb up the
sign, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; this large Hertz sign here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the top of the School Book Depository Building on Exhibit 362.</p>

<p>All right. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Then I came back down and I went and checked this building
right here. It is an old deserted room there of some type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Some kind of a shack on the northeast corner of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Out there. What did you see when you saw that shack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I approached it, and looked under it, there wasn't anything
under it, and you could tell that pigeons had been roosting there for sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. There were indications that pigeons had been roosting
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No indications that anyone would be around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any pigeons there as you approached it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir. They had all&mdash;at the time I kind of glanced and they
were still flying around in the sky up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You referred to pigeons, did you see some pigeon droppings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Had they been disturbed in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At that time I went on back. Mr. Truly was standing over here
on this northwest corner and we descended on the stairs there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went from the stairs to the roof to where, to the top floor
of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the top floor of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We walked on down one more flight of stairs and then we
caught the same elevator back down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The top floor was the seventh floor, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, you have one flight of stairs going from the top floor on up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And then we caught the elevator back down, the same elevator
that we took up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you referred to one flight of stairs, are you referring to the
flight of stairs from the roof to the top floor that you took or the flight of stairs
from the top floor to the next to the top floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, there are two flights of stairs there. The one from the
roof down to the top floor and then there is another one there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you took the elevator back did you take it from the top
floor down or from the next to the top floor down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That elevator to me, it didn't go to the top floor, it goes to the
next to the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take it as far as it went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When&mdash;did you take an elevator down or did you take the stairs
down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We took the elevator down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take the same elevator down you took up or did you take
a different elevator down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We took the same one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you went to take that elevator going back down did you
notice whether or not the other elevator was there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I didn't notice. It would be to my back and I was looking out
forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It would be to your back from where you came off the stairs going
to the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Are you talking about when we got on the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got on the elevator to make the return trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. There wasn't one there whenever we come around out of the
stairway, you know, to get on, you know we had to get on the east side instead
of just stepping over on the west elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, I am going to hand you what the court reporter,
what the Commission reporter, has marked as Exhibit 507 which purports to
be a diagram of the seventh floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building
and on that diagram you will see at the top the marks of two elevators and
then, what looks to be the south, a stairway marked "Ladder to the roof."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not this stairway marked
"Ladder to the roof" is the stairway that you took to go to the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, when you got off the elevator which you took up to the top floor, which
you said was the east <span class="locked">elevator&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any occasion to notice whether or not the west
elevator was on this top floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I didn't notice it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't notice whether it was or whether it was not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got back down from the roof to this top floor, did you
have any occasion to notice whether or not the west elevator was on that top
floor or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I still didn't look at the elevator. I was following Mr.
Truly and every time I had a chance I would look around over the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You would look over the floor itself rather than the other elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then got on the elevator to go on back down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And I believe you said it was the east elevator, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you take the east elevator down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As we descended, somewhere around&mdash;we were still talking and
I was still looking over the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As the elevator was moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; downward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. The next thing that I noticed was Inspector Sawyer, he was on
one of those floors there, he is a police inspector.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. City of Dallas Police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. And he was on, I really didn't notice which floor he
was on, but that is the first thing I saw as we descended how this freight
elevator, you know, it has got these picket boards in front of it and it has got
it open so far, and it seemed to me like we stopped for a moment and I spoke to
him and I told him that I had been to the roof, and there wasn't anything on
the roof that would indicate anybody being up there, and then we started on
down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you stay on the elevator while you spoke to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what floor it was that you spoke to him on or
how many floors down that you went from the top before you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; not at that time. It seemed to me like it was on either
the third or the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember about how long you stayed on the roof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It was a little over 5 minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you continued moving on the elevator after you talked
to Inspector Sawyer how far did you go on the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We went to the, I believe it would be the first floor there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You got off the elevator then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you leave Mr. Truly or did you stay with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I left Mr. Truly there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I immediately went on out. I was with this motorcade and
I went right on straight through the front door and got on my motorcycle and tried
to find out what happened to the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, when you left the building had the building been
sealed off or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; there was an officer at the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The officer at the front door, was he stopping people from coming
in and out or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I assumed that he was but I, you know, just went on out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>When you got to the first floor on the east elevator did you notice whether
the west elevator was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything else that you observed in or about the Texas
School Book Depository Building at that day that you haven't told us about
that you can think of right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I can't think of anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From the time you went into the building how long did it take
you to go up and make your searches and come on down until the time you
left, to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I would say that I was in there approximately 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you left there right at the time that you left Mr. Truly
on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In this time sequence you mentioned you were on the roof more
than 5 minutes, that could be 25 or 30 or 10 or 15 or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This, to my recollection, it seemed like I shouldn't have stayed
up there over 10 minutes anyway, if that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you would say somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I just ran around up there looking for something; I didn't
find it and then we came on down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Dulles, are there any questions that you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have no more questions. Have you any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, I believe you testified that you later saw Lee
Harvey Oswald at the police station of the homicide office, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this later on that same day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you state whether or not the man who was shown to you
in the police station as Lee Harvey Oswald was or was not the same man
that you saw and encountered on the second floor lunchroom of the Texas
School Book Depository Building on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He was the same man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else about his clothes that you can remember
or his dress that you haven't talked about here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you recall whether or not he was wearing the same clothes,
did he appear to you the same when you saw him in the police station as
when you saw him in the lunchroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Actually just looking at him, he looked like he didn't have the
same thing on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He looked as though he did not have the same thing on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He looked like he did not have the same on.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you say when you first saw this man walking away
from you in the lunchroom, walking away in the opposite direction, that you
said for him to come toward you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he turn around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The officer testified he had a pistol in his hand at that time,
Officer Baker?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. He did have a pistol in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I had the pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Officer Baker had a pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I see. Did he move toward you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was there anything about his appearance that was unusual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir. Whenever I called to him, well he turned around and
I had my gun in my hand, you know, and he started walking back towards me
and I walked to meet him, and I met him at that doorway over there and about
that time Mr. Truly who had started on up the stairs and then he came back,
he found that I wasn't with him, came back, and walked up there aside of him
and just about the time we met all three of us got there together and I turned
to Mr. Truly and I asked him, and I said, "Do you know this man? Does he
work here?"</p>

<p>And he said, "Yes," and that is whenever I turned and went on up the stairs.
At that time he didn't say a word, he didn't change the expression or nothing
on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You testified, I believe, that he did not seem to be out of
breath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. He did not show any evidence of any emotion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see anyone else while you were in the building, other
than this man you have identified later as Oswald, and Mr. Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. On the first floor there were two men. As we came through the
main doorway to the elevators, I remember as we tried to get on the elevators I
remember two men, one was sitting on this side and another one between 20 or
30 feet away from us looking at us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were they white men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, we have an exhibit here 362 showing the first floor
of the School Book Depository Building, and the top part of the exhibit is south.
It is a little bit upside down from the usual top being north.</p>

<p>You will notice here the stairway in the front of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then there is a glass swinging door which I believe is shown
there.</p>

<p>Could you mark the point at which you believe you were when you called
out for someone to tell you where the stairway or elevator was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Is that the steps on the outside and this is <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. These are the steps on the outside, this is the door, the first door
and this is kind of the main lobby here, below the words "Main Entrance."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, as you come up the steps, there is a glass door here in front
of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon me, this will be the recessed glass door right here swinging?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. All of this is the lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, that is all the lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. OK. This is the first door that you open to get in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And this is the lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And then you have another set of glass doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There is another door right here, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And on through this one you have a swinging door, a little old
counter-type door that <span class="locked">swings&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This would be the swinging door which would be to the west of
the room marked "Mr. Truly's office" on Exhibit 362?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where would you have been when you were yelling would someone
tell you about the stairs or the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At this point approximately where the "T" is here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You would be where the "T" is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I was standing inside the front doors and I wasn't too far from
this door here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be the, what I call the, middle set of doors as you
come in, between the front set of doors and the doors by the side of Mr. Truly's
office, that little half door there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you were at the point as marked on Exhibit 362 approximately
where the word "T" is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This lobby, to the best of my recollection, it seemed to me like,
would&mdash;I would say, about 15 feet wide or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. And I had come in there, oh, say, 4 or 5 feet whenever I said,
"Where is the stairway or the elevator?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if you could show us on Exhibit 362 the route that you
took from the first floor to the time you went to the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I came through the first set of doors, the second set and this
second little old counter-type here, and kind of ran through that, from the southwest
corner here through this swinging door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is by Mr. Truly's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; to the northwest corner here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the west elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. West elevator, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this be roughly along the pen line already in there, would
you estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; that is pretty close to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then went to the east elevator where Mr. Truly first pushed
the button for the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any further questions? Mr. Attorney General, do you have any
questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. There is just one. There were many people around there at that
time, and the rest of the <span class="locked">day&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are talking now about the Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. Yes, sir; at the time he has been testifying about. Did you have
occasion during the rest of the day either in passing visits or idle conversation
or anything of that type with any of the people that were there at the time who
might have seen something or told you some theory they had about what might
have happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Not until last Friday morning. Chief Lunday, which is my chief
in traffic, called me and asked me to go down to this Texas Depository Building,
and I had&mdash;I have worked traffic outside several times but I never did go inside
or talk to any of the employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. I am referring to the people who were out there at the time of
the shooting. Did you have a chance during that day to talk with any of them
or did you overhear any conversations that might be material to the investigation
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. The only ones that I talked to would be the solo officers who were
around him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Around whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Around the President's car at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was the nature of those conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, we just were discussing, each one of us had a theory, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
know where, how it happened, and really none of us knew how it happened,
it just happened, and where they was at in place, you know, in reference to
the car, would be about the only thing they could say, and at the time the first
shot they didn't know where the shot came from.</p>

<p>The second shot they still didn't know, and then the third shot some of
them over to the left-hand side, the blood and everything hit their helmets
and their windshields and then they knew it had to come from behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Say this again, Officer Baker. When you say some were on
the left-hand side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, I believe Officer B.&nbsp;J. <span class="locked">Martin&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is he a motorcycle policeman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On a one- or two-wheeler or three-wheeler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He is a solo motorcycle, two-wheeler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he riding at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He was on the left front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. There were five motorcycle officers in front. There were four,
two on each right side behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say in front and behind of what vehicle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. We are referring to the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. He was on the front and to the left of the President's
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say to you about blood or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Like I say, we were talking about where the shot came from,
and he said the first shot he couldn't figure it out where it came from. He
turned his head backward, reflex, you know, and then he turned back and the
second shot came off, and then the third shot is when the blood and everything
hit his helmet and his windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it hit the inside or the outside of his windshield, did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It hit all this inside. Now, as far as the inside or outside of
the windshield. I don't know about that. But it was all on the right-hand
side of his helmet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of his helmet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. On his uniform also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On his uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And he was riding to the left of the President and you say ahead
of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. On the left-hand side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But a little ahead of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. They were immediately in front of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any other conversations&mdash;pardon me, does that answer your
question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. I was more interested, sir, in that, of course, but with the laymen
around there. There was a lot of talk and theorizing at the time and I
was just wondering what he might have heard from any of the laymen, or
just ordinary onlookers of the parade, did you get a chance to talk to any
of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. At that time I didn't get a chance to talk to any of those. At
that time I immediately got on my motorcycle and went on down to the Trade
Mart down there where he was set up for the luncheon and at the time I got
on there I didn't stop until here come a sergeant and a medical examiner and
they wanted me to take them code 3 to Parkland, at the time I got there we
stood around the President's car there and kept the crowd back, and that is
where I stayed until, I think we left after they loaded the body, we went to
Love Field and stayed there for, say, 30 minutes or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to&mdash;pardon me, sir, does that take care of your
questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. Yes, sir; thank you very much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any further questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. No; thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to any of the other officers who were in or about
the President's vehicle at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I talked to several of them and all of them had kind
of had the same story, you know. It had to come from above and behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you talk to these officers, like Officer Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That was&mdash;I didn't talk to him until we got back to the city
hall, which we got off, we were supposed to get off at 3 o'clock that day, we
got off around 4 the same time, they called us all in together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What other officers did you talk to and what did they say that
you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I talked to Jim Chaney, and he made the statement that the
two shots hit Kennedy first and then the other one hit the Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. He was on the right rear of the car or to the side, and then at
that time the chief of police, he didn't know anything about this, and he moved
up and told him, and then that was during the time that the Secret Service
men were trying to get in the car, and at the time, after the shooting, from
the time the first shot rang out, the car stopped completely, pulled to the left
and stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. Now, I have heard several of them say that, Mr. Truly
was standing out there, he said it stopped. Several officers said it stopped
completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You saw it stop, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; I didn't see it stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You just heard from others that it had stopped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; that it had completely stopped, and then for a moment
there, and then they rushed on out to Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, did this Officer Chaney say anything else about, for
instance, where he thought the source of the shots was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Not&mdash;he knew they came from behind him but he didn't know
where. He said from down there they was kind of going down that hill and
said that shot, the sound of it, you couldn't tell just exactly where it came
from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did he know it came from behind then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Because he was riding from behind, and whenever it hit the
President, he said he would see him fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you are giving a motion now, did he see him fall backwards
first or forwards or when you say fall what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, he just said, when they hit he kind of fell, so I assumed he
went to the left of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Did any other officer say anything to you about what he saw or thought what
happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I talked to several of them but I can't remember exactly, you
know, just what their story was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anyone you talked to who thought the shots came from
the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; not except that the chief of police that is the only one.</p>

<p>Now, that, like I say, that is the last thing I heard over that radio is "Get
some men up on that railroad." Now, that could mean they either came from
the side, which is due north, or right across in front of him. You <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, apart from the statement you testified to that the chief
of police made over the radio about the underpass, was there any policeman
or patrolman who was in the motorcade who in any way indicated to you that
the shots came from the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I would like to ask a couple of questions.</p>

<p>I think you said when you went inside the depository you saw no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
except the man you later identified as Oswald, and Mr. Truly. There were
two people sitting down on the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I entered that depository building, I was&mdash;people were running
toward you, I don't know whether they worked there or whether they were
just trying to get out of the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. From inside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No; from the street in. As I ran in I was pushing them aside
and running through them, and some way, Mr. Truly got from my back to my
front.</p>

<p>Now, he said he was right behind me. I never did see him until I got in and
asked the question of where the stairs was, so evidently whenever I went in
the door why he came on in. There were several people coming in as I, you
know, came in, there were several in front of me and also around my sides and
my back. And it seemed to me like a double door deal.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. As you went up on the elevator could you see out of the
elevator onto floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. The best that I could, that is the reason I wasn't
paying too much attention to the elevator I was looking around all those
floors.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say up on the elevator, he didn't get on the elevator
until he had got up on the stairs.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I am aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I was still looking.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You went up on the second floor by stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Then you got on the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, sir; he didn't get on the elevator until the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Anyway, as you walked up the stairs could you see into
each floor space as you passed from floor to floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Partly. Now, this building has got pillars in it, you know, and
then it has got books, cases of books stacked all in it. And the best that I
could, you know, I would look through there and see if I could see anybody.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When you looked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Not from the second floor on up.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. As you approached the building by motorcycle, did you notice
whether anyone was looking out of the windows of the Texas School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. Those windows, I would say a number of them were
open and I tell you, to the best of my recollection, I scanned those windows,
but I can't recall anybody looking out of them, you know. I looked at all them
buildings so much and there were people looking out of every one of them,
every doorway and every window, and I really was looking high more at the
roof of it than I was anything, and I really didn't see nothing in the windows.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I may be repeating because I missed the first part of his
testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But when you heard the shot, you said later you saw some
pigeons fly up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What was the sequence of time between the time you saw
the flight of the pigeons and you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. As I got that motorcycle straightened up, and I hadn't gone just
a very few feet there, it didn't seem like, you know, I went very far, but it is
possible I went, we figured maybe 80, 60 to 80 feet there, and I looked up, as
the shots started, I immediately looked up, you know. I was already facing
ahead and I just kind of raised, I sighted up, and while I was looking up,
those other two shots came off, and as I come up, I noticed those pigeons start
to fly up there, but I really didn't see which, there were so many of them I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
couldn't tell which building they were coming from but I know they were all
over.</p>

<p>Say you were facing north like Houston they were in the sky facing north
in the street.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Which way were the pigeons going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. They were just coming up, you know.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I assume you are a hunter, aren't you, from what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I try to be.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Have you seen birds in flight when they are suddenly
startled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Well, was this the character of the flight of pigeons you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; that is the way it seemed to me, that these birds, you
know, just with a sudden uprush.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you have any notice of anyone saying there might have
been a shot from the railroad until you heard the statement over the radio just
before you entered the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. No, sir; that was the only words that I remember that was said
over the radio from the time the shots rang out until I started parking that
motorcycle, and when I came off of it I heard those words.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Could you see the railroad yards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I could see it&mdash;this track ran under this triple underpass
to my left, all out behind this building.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you see anything there which attracted your attention
other <span class="locked">than&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Nothing <span class="locked">except&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. There were people all over this track, over this triple underpass,
and people just standing all over this sloping bank there, you know, going up.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were there any officers that you saw near the School Book
Depository when you went in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. There was an officer working traffic on that corner, and Officer
J.&nbsp;W. Williams <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. By that corner you mean the corner of Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir. J.&nbsp;W. Williams who is a motorcycle officer,
was, I thought, over on the left-hand side of me, and he was right with me,
but as I ran in this building, I found out that I was by myself. I didn't know
where anybody went.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you later see J.&nbsp;W. Williams, Officer Williams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. He stated that when the motorcade left with the
President, and they immediately went code 3 to Parkland, why he was up
there with him and he went up there with him. And I later saw him out there
at Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You testified, I believe, that you did not yourself see the President's
car stop. You just were told it was stopped by several other officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Let me say, as I parked that motorcycle, I looked down there,
well, the car had swerved to the left, and I saw this man run out into this
crowd and back. I don't know who he was but I saw that and I saw these
people following him, and all these pressmen jumping out of their cars and
running down the street toward him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, do you know from where this man ran off into
the crowd at all or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Apparently he came from one of the cars right there by the
President's car. He was, he came from the motorcade, inside the motorcade
out to the sidewalk and then back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You mentioned the fact that you had gone or come back from deer hunting
just prior to November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of a weapon did you have when you went deer hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I had one of these .30-06, I believe the Springfield type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is it a rifle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Automatic or bolt action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Bolt action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you owned a rifle, any rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. This particular one I have had it approximately 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you had much experience to go hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir. Every year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Every year you go deer hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have had occasion to hear shots from your rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From other rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did this in any way influence your decisions as to what you did
on November 22 as you heard the first sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what way did it influence them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. To me it was immediately a rifle shot. A lot of the solo officers
said they thought it was the backfire from a motorcycle because you can make
those motorcycles pop pretty loud. But that instant it just, I don't know, it just
hit me as a rifle shot.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How long have you been firing a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Say, from the time I was about 17 years old.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Have you fired other types of rifles other than the one you
used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; the first one I had was a 30-30 Marlin lever type.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Have you ever seen the rifle that is alleged to have belonged
to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I saw it, a photograph of it, in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you know what kind of rifle it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Not offhand. I heard it was some foreign make gun. Most of
the boys down there at the police department have had dealings with foreign type
guns, rifles, you know of this kind, and a lot of them sell them, and a lot of
them rework them, you know, make them into deer rifles.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What were the characteristics of the report that you heard,
three reports, which made you believe that it was a shot from a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Well, they were too distinct, you know, to be&mdash;I have heard
that pop from that motorcycle and I have heard rifle shots, and to me there was
just a difference in them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Baker, did it appear to you that these sounds that you
heard were from the same rifle or from possibly more than one rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I would say they was from the same rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it appear that the sounds all came from the same source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. With regard to the closeness of these sounds together, how fast
they came, did it appear that it came from or that it could have come from
a weapon that had to be operated by bolt action as opposed to a semiautomatic
or an automatic weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. It seemed to me like you could either fire a semi or bolt action in
about the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you had occasion to use a bolt action rifle and fire shots
quickly one after the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it appear that, from what you heard, that from your experience
you could have operated your own bolt action rifle as quickly as those
shots came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. If you made any judgment, what was the length of time
from the time you heard the first report until you heard the third?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. I would say just about as fast as you could bolt one of those
bolt action rifles which wouldn't be&mdash;I don't believe it would be over 3 seconds
apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Over what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Three seconds apart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From each shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Three seconds from the first to the second and another 3 seconds
from the second to the third?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are saying not over 3 seconds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>. Not over 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any further questions?</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Officer Baker. Your testimony has been very helpful.
(At this point Senator Cooper left the hearing room.)</p>

<h2 id="rar">TESTIMONY OF MRS. ROBERT A. REID</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mrs. Reid, the Chief Justice had to leave a few moments and he
expressed his regret to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So I am presiding over the Commission at the present time.</p>

<p>As you possibly have been informed, the purpose of the testimony this morning
has been to hear the testimony of Officer Baker, yourself, and certain others
who were in the vicinity of the Texas School Book Depository Building at
the time of the assassination of the President, and we will ask you give testimony
in that connection and anything else you may know.</p>

<p>Would you please rise, Mrs. Reid, and hold up your right hand.</p>

<p>Do you swear the testimony you will give before this Commission is the
truth, the whole truth, so help you God, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Belin will carry forward the interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We met in Dallas on Friday, March 20.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Reid, could you state your name for the Commission, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Mrs. Robert A. Reid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is R-e-i-d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. R-e-i-d, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where do you live, Mrs. Reid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. 1914 Elmwood Boulevard, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And are you originally from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, I have been for quite a number of years. I was born out
in a little town out from Dallas, Cereal, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you go to school in Dallas? Did you go through
high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I completed high school there and I married and went to Waxahachie
and lived there about 15 years and moved back to Dallas then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any family, Mrs. Reid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. You mean like sisters or my children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, children.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Both, I have six sisters and I have two children and a grandchild.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have a grandchild?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. And a husband, and a family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation, Mrs. Reid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I am a clerical supervisor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For what company?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you worked for the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I have been 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you been a clerical supervisor all the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I started out in the department on what they call their postage
desk and I was appointed to a clerical supervisor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Reid, I am taking you to November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you on that day commencing with, say, around
noon or so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, at 12 I went to lunch, and I had my lunch rather hurriedly
so that I might go downstairs and watch the parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Reid, you say you ate your lunch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you eat your lunch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. In our lunchroom, in the lunchroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. On two, the same floor as our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is on the second floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you buy your lunch or bring your lunch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I brought my lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anyone in the lunchroom when you were eating lunch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember who was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, the girls that work under me, the young ladies, goodness,
it is all hard for me to remember how many there were, but the general ones
that usually eat there with me every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Commission Exhibit 497, is this room, this lunchroom, the
one that is marked "lunchroom" here with the numbers 25 and 26 in it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And that is where you ate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And on Commission Exhibit 497 do you work on the second floor
also?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the area marked with the room "office space," somewhere
in that room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say you work over near the dumbwaiter which is marked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. My <span class="locked">desk&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your desk is near the dumbwaiter on Exhibit 497.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is the desk there, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is the dumbwaiter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mrs. Reid, you left lunch about what time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, I left, I ate my lunch hurriedly, I wasn't watching the
time but I wanted to be sure of getting out on the streets in time for the
parade before he got there, and I called my husband, who works at the records
building, and they had a radio in their office and they were listening as the
parade progressed and he told me they were running about 10 minutes late.
But I went down rather soon and stood on the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where was your husband working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. He works for the records building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, it is off the left-hand side, kind of cater-cornered across
from our building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The records building has one side of it on Elm Street running
from Houston to Record Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And I believe it is on, it would run on, the south side of Elm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Do you know about what time it was that you left the
lunchroom, was it 12, 12:15?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I think around 12:30 somewhere along in there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. When you left the lunchroom, did you leave with the
other girls?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I didn't. The younger girls had gone and I left alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you the last person in the lunchroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I could not say that because I don't remember that part of it
because I was going out of the building by myself, I wasn't even, you know,
connected with anyone at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there any men in the lunchroom when you left there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I can't, I don't, remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I can't remember the time they left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you went out from the lunchroom; turning to Exhibit 497, you
went from the lunchroom through the door, which would be the west door, and
then through the doorway marked number 23 on the exhibit there or did you
instead go to the front?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I came back through the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't go through the door marked 24?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You came out through this first door of the lunchroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you turned which way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Turned this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You turned to your left and went through the door which is
between numbers 27 and 28?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Exhibit 497, and you went back to your office. Did you go
by your desk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I am sure I did because I usually leave my purse in there until
I get ready to go out and then pick it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You walked toward the number marked 29 on Exhibit
497?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then where did you walk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I came over here and got my jacket and scarf out of the closet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You are now pointing to the closet on Exhibit 497 which would be located on
the east side of the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Toward the front. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I came and went out this door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are, you went out the door which is marked on Exhibit 497
as room 200, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I got on the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, there is an elevator along the east wall toward the front of
the building, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is this a freight or passenger?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. It is a passenger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know how far this elevator goes or how high?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Fourth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Fourth floor. You got on the elevator on the second floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Came down on the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you came on the first floor.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Went out the front door of our building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Went out the front door.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I stood on the steps for several minutes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Shall I continue?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Until I saw the parade coming around the corner from Main and
Houston and when I did I walked out to the street so I would be nearer to the
people, and I walked out and was standing by Mr. Truly and Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. This was in front of the steps, ma'am?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, no; I had gone out directly in the front but I had gotten
nearer to the street than the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were actually onto the street then as the motorcade came by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; that is right. There is a part in there where our streets,
one goes this way and one kind of goes off this way, and the line of parade
they were going that way and I got right on the curb and was standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, turning to Exhibit 361, the top of Exhibit 361 faces south
and this is Houston Street, here is the School Book Depository Building that I
am pointing to.</p>

<p>Can you give any estimate as to where you were with relation to this, well,
I will call it a peninsula of land between the parkway and the building.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. You have got me turned around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The parade was coming along Houston.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I was standing about along in here, in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were standing a little bit to the north of the spot marked
"B" on Exhibit 361.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you would be directly in front of the main entrance of the
School Book Depository, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, by "B" I am referring to, on Exhibit 361, I am referring to
the pen ink&mdash;pen and ink "B" which is directly to the east of what I will call
the traffic light on that peninsula of land as Elm goes into the parkway there.
All right, what did you see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. You mean when I was standing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see and hear and do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, I was naturally watching for the car as the President came
by. I looked at him and I was very anxious to see Mrs. Kennedy, I looked at
her and I was going to see how she was dressed and she was dressed very
attractive and she put up her hand to her hat and was holding it on, the wind
was blowing a little bit and then went on right on by me and that is the last as
far as the parade, I mean as far as they were concerned.</p>

<p>I did see Johnson, and that was it. I can't even tell you any more about
the parade because after the shots I didn't know any part about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see and hear and do after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, when I heard&mdash;I heard three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You heard three shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. And I turned to Mr. Campbell and I said, "Oh, my goodness, I am
afraid those came from our building," because it seemed like they came just so
directly over my head, and then I looked up in the windows, and saw three
colored boys up there, I only recognized one because I didn't know the rest of
them so well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which one did you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. James Jarman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You recognized James Jarman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; because I had had some dealings with him in the business
part and I knew him. I couldn't have told you the other two at all because I
didn't know them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember that floor you saw them on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, I wasn't exactly looking at the floor, I don't know, I would
say a couple of floors up. I mean several anyway. I don't know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't remember which floor it was.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I couldn't tell you because, you know, I didn't count the floors
and I didn't count them, and I made the statement "Oh, I hope they don't think
any of our boys have done this" and I had no thoughts of anything like that. I
turned and went back in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, let me ask you this then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before you turned and went back into the building did you&mdash;did
Mr. Campbell say anything to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. He said, "Oh, Mrs. Reid, no, it came from the grassy area down
this way," and that was the last I said to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. When he said "this way" which direction was he
pointing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, I hope I get my directions. In the direction of the parade
was going, in the bottom of that direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, did you look around after the shots and notice what people
were doing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, it was just a mass of confusion. I saw people beginning to
fall, and the thought that went through my mind, my goodness I must get out
of this line of shots, they may fire some more. And don't ask me why I went
into the building because I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anything else of people running or doing anything
else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; because I ran into the building. I do not recall seeing anyone
in the lobby. I ran up to our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just 1 second there. How long after the third shot did you run
into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Dulles, we did a reconstruction on that time sequence on
Friday and I am going to come to that as soon as I get the route first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went into the building in the main lobby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take the elevator or the stairs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I went up the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this the front stairs or the back stairs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; the front stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You went up through the stairs and then what did
you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I went into the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went into your office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, I kept walking and I looked up and Oswald was coming in
the back door of the office. I met him by the time I passed my desk several
feet and I told him, I said, "Oh, the President has been shot, but maybe they
didn't hit him."</p>

<p>He mumbled something to me, I kept walking, he did, too. I didn't pay any
attention to what he said because I had no thoughts of anything of him having
any connection with it at all because he was very calm. He had gotten a coke
and was holding it in his hands and I guess the reason it impressed me seeing
him in there I thought it was a little strange that one of the warehouse boys
would be up in the office at the time, not that he had done anything wrong.
The only time I had seen him in the office was to come and get change and he
already had his coke in his hand so he didn't come for change and I dismissed
him. I didn't think anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you saw him, I believe you said you first saw him when
he was coming through the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Turning to Exhibit 497, what doorway was it where you first
saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to the doorway between numbers 27 and 28?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Exhibit 497?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when you saw him in that doorway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I was coming right through here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to what number there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, it is 29.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 29. And then about where were you when you actually passed
him or had this exchange?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Right along here. I passed my desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why don't you put on Exhibit 496 an "X" as to where you were
when you thought you passed him.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if you would put the initial "R" which we will put for
Mrs. Reid.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the "X" and that is where you were when you passed him.</p>

<p>On March 20 you and I met for the first time, didn't we, Mrs. Reid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We sat down and I asked you to tell me what happened and you
related the story. Did I keep on questioning you or did you tell me what
happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, I more or less told you what had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Then we went out on the street, did we not, in front
of the building, with a stopwatch, do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; I surely do. It was kind of cool.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was kind of cool wasn't it, and a little bit windy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; it was; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And when in Dallas, we started the stopwatch from the time
that the last shot was fired, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you went through your actions, what you saw, your
conversations that you had, and your actions in going back into the building
and up to the point that you saw Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how long by the stopwatch it took you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Approximately 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I didn't hear you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Two minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From the time of the last shot the time you and Oswald crossed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; I believe that is the way we timed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you&mdash;you saw me start the stopwatch and you saw me stop
it there, right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you met in the <span class="locked">lunchroom&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I didn't meet him in the lunchroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon me, when you met in the office, which direction were
you going, looking toward Exhibit 497, as you look on it, which direction were
you going toward the left or right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. You mean as I came in the office? I turned in and turned to my
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be heading in a westerly direction is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What direction was Oswald walking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. He was going east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him actually walk through or coming through the
door there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. He had just gotten to the door, was stepping in as I glanced up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was stepping in as you glanced up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you ever&mdash;you said, I will put it this way, had you ever
seen Oswald in that second floor office space before apart from the time of
getting his pay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, one other time he came in, now he might have been in to
get that change for this time but I didn't see him going up there, and he made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
a remark to one of the girls back there and she said, "Well, he sure is calm."
And I said, "What did he say to you?"</p>

<p>And she says, "I have a baby," and he stopped and I said, "Well, he is pretty
calm just having a new baby," and outside of that I never remember seeing him
other than to come in to get change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the other men in the warehouse, did they have
occasion to come into that office space?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Occasionally they come up to get change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Apart from getting change or getting paid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; very seldom unless they are sent up there to get something.
I mean they just don't come in there and wander around. It is some business
for them.</p>

<p>Now, I did see him in the lunchroom a few times prior to this eating his lunch
but I didn't even know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you know his name on the day you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I did not. When I saw his picture I still didn't know his
name until they told us who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you know the person you saw was Lee Harvey Oswald
on the second floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Because it looked just like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the picture with the name Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But you had seen him in the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Other than that day, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what clothes he had on when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. What he was wearing, he had on a white T-shirt and some kind
of wash trousers. What color I couldn't tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to hand you what has been marked Commission Exhibit,
first 157 and then 158, and I will ask you if either or both look like they might
have been the trousers that you saw him wear or can you tell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I just couldn't be positive about that. I would rather not say,
because I just cannot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether he had any shirt or jacket on over
his T-shirt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. He did not. He did not have any jacket on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever seen anyone working at the book depository wearing
any kind of a shirt or jacket similar to Commission Exhibit 150 or do you
know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I do not. I have never, so far as I know ever seen that
shirt. I have been asked about that shirt before, I have seen it once before but
not since all this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Mrs. Reid, if a person were in the lunchroom with a
coke on the second floor, and then wanted to get to the front stairway or
front elevator, would there be only one route to get there or would there be
more than one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; he could either go around this hallway, or back here in
this hallway or he could have gotten through our office <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I wonder if in the first hallway you could mark route 1 there so we have
it on 496.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Does it matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is fine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. You said the front stairway, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is the front stairway. You have put a number 1, I am
going to put "R-1".</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And that will be one hallway to go down to get from the lunchroom
to the front stairway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, would there be another way to get there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. He can come through the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You could come through the office?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which is the way Lee Harvey Oswald was walking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would any one way be faster than the other or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. It couldn't be very much faster because it is practically the same
distance here that it is here and you have got this hallway there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So, either "R-1" or going through the office marked 29 would be
approximately the same?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, where you saw Lee Harvey Oswald is there kind of a pathway
through there without any obstructions for desks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; there is, sort of a passageway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You passed at point what you have marked with an "X"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. With an "R" and "X" to it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Lee Harvey Oswald walk past you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Kept on walking in the same direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you see him go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I didn't turn around to look. He went on straight, he did not
go on past the back door because I was facing that way. What he did after
<span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But you know he did not go out the same back door he came in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not he went into the conference room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, I wouldn't think he did because this door off here was locked
and I had unlocked it for the policeman myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, let's put an arrow here to the door that you say was
locked, and we will put&mdash;do you want to put in the word "locked" in there, if
you would, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. On which side was it locked or did you take the key away, was
it locked so that <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I would go in from this way. I wasn't going in from our office
into the conference room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And you locked that door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. We did. They had asked me, I went in there with the policeman
into the conference room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you take the key?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes, sir; I did, I got it for Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No; I mean after you locked the door do you leave the key in
the lock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What I want to know is this, Mrs. Reid. When you came back
up into the building after the shooting and you walked into the conference
room, at that time was the door which you have marked "locked," was it locked
at that time when you came in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes, sir; it was to&mdash;it was locked when I got to it, I will say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Had you been the one who had locked it
before or don't you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Oh, no, I couldn't say that because too many people used the
conference room.</p>

<p>I would have no way of knowing who locked it or if it is left unlocked. The
porter locks it in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>If one is locking that door with a key do you lock the door from the inside of
the conference room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Either way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Or the outside, either way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who has custody of the key?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I got that from Mr. Williams' desk, because that is where I got it
from, and then the porter has one. I could not say. They all have the keys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you get it to unlock the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, by the time the policeman got there and started searching
our floor. I can't recall whether I had taken him into the lounge first because
they had me to go in there with him, the ladies' lounge, or whether they went in
there because there is a little stand in here that Mr. Cason uses when we have
a conference, and he jerked it back because it would have been humanly possible
for a person to have gotten in there, but it was up against the wall and
there was no one there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this have been more or less than 5 minutes after you got
back in the building that you opened the lounge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is where you all get me in this time because I was not
watching the clock that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Time really didn't mean anything to us because they, the police
officers, just came in on us and began to ask so many questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you were at point "RX" and moving, if someone would have
walked into the conference room would you have heard him in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I could have heard him open the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You could hear them open the door. During the time, the period
of time you were there and saw Lee Harvey Oswald, did you hear anyone open
the door to the conference room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I do not recall any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From your best judgment, if Lee Harvey Oswald didn't go into
the conference room and didn't go back to the door marked around between 27
and 28, how would he have gotten out of the office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Right straight out this door down this stairway and out the front
door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are saying right down the hallway in the direction in which
the arrow number 29 is pointing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Down through the hall and down through the front stairway.</p>

<p>Have you ever talked to anyone there who ever saw Lee Harvey Oswald leave
the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know of your own personal knowledge how he got out of
the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I do not, I do not. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Reid, did you notice whether or not the man you ran into
on the second floor whom you now identify as Lee Harvey Oswald was carrying
anything in either arm other than a coke?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the coke full or empty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. It was full.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was full.</p>

<p>Was there anything else you noticed about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything about the expression on his face?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; just calm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything about whether or not his clothes were clean or dirty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, they were clean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything about whether or not his hair was combed or mussed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I did not. There wasn't anything unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say he mumbled something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you even remember one word that he mumbled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I did not because he kept moving and I did, too, and I was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
not interested in what he was saying, it was just the excitement of time and
I didn't even say, "What did you say?" because I wasn't interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was he moving fast?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; because he was moving at a very slow pace, I never did see
him moving fast at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was moving just at his normal walk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether he was wearing any pieces of jewelry
like a watch or bracelet or ring or something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I do not remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Reid, did you ever have any personal contact with Lee Harvey
Oswald about such things as his paycheck or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what hand he was carrying his coke in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. In his right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Reid, we thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just one moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon me, do you have a question, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How many times do you think you saw Mr. Oswald during the
period he was employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. My goodness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Roughly.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. It couldn't have <span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Five times, 10 times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I would say five times. At times I would go down to Mr. Truly's
office for some business. I would see him across the floor, but he paid no attention
to you and there were times, the few times, he ate lunch up there but
he never talked to anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Never talked to anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. And he was usually reading, I noticed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he seem to repel ordinary conversational attempts or didn't
you try that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I never did try it, I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You never tried it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. He seemed to be interested in what he was doing, I would never
see anyone talking to him at all in the lunchroom so far as I can recall, not
any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Who in the organization so far as you know would have handled
his paychecks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Campbell would have handled his paychecks.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. He makes them out and then he sends them to Mr. Truly and
I am sure he distributes it to his employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Two questions, Mrs. Reid.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When we reconstructed your actions on Friday, March 20, which
you said it took about 2 minutes, would you say that this was a maximum or
minimum time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, it wasn't any less than that I am sure because 2 minutes
<span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did we kind of run?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes, we did, three times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Three times.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And we were both huffing and puffing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes, we were. I know I was that day, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Reid, since the tragedy of November 22, have there been
any discussions that you have heard among any employees which might relate
to the character insofar as the personal habits or what-have-you of Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. The only thing I have heard anybody say was he never talked
to anybody, he always went about his business, that is the only thing I heard
the employees say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever hear anyone say that he might have been friendly
with at least one other employee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did the employees discuss him at all among themselves?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. You mean prior to this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Prior, during the period he was employed there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At the Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. I never heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They did not discuss him in your presence, the office employees?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Well, the office employees and the warehouse employees are not
connected. We talk to them, naturally some of them have been there a long
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was it your usual practice to take lunch in the lunchroom on
the second floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes, it is; every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you recall whether it was Lee Harvey Oswald's usual practice
or how many times possibly you saw him there at lunch with you and the
others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. You mean did he come up every day? No, he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you think he came up half the days or could you give
any&mdash;half the working days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; I wouldn't say he came that often. I can't recall seeing
him up there but three times. We have said since then, since he sat there
and didn't say anything and was reading we have often wondered what we
discussed before him because we all have a general conversation every day
at noon but I don't know we would have said anything that interested him.</p>

<p>But you wondered was he listening to what we were saying, I don't know
whether he heard anything but he may have heard what we were saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You, of course, knew that Lee Harvey Oswald was an employee
of the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. You mean by name before this happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That the individual that you later knew was Oswald was one
of the employees of the school book?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Yes, because I had seen him working in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes. Attorney General Carr, do you have any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. Mrs. Reid, have you had occasion to visit with any of Oswald's
relatives, his wife or mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. Have they been in there since that date to look over the premises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. His mother has been but I didn't see her. She didn't go any
further than the first floor I understand, but I have never seen her other than
these pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is it usual for the employees of the depository to have friends
visit them during office hours or would that be an unusual practice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. No; that would not be unusual. Family or somebody wanted to
drop by to see you they never have objected to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think the record should show we are offering in evidence this
morning, Mr. Dulles, Commission Exhibit 507 which is the diagram of the
seventh floor which Officer Baker testified to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You want that admitted now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We want that admitted now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No objection. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The diagram referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 507 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think those are all the questions we have of Mrs. Reid.</p>

<p>We want to thank you very much for your cooperation in coming up here,
Mrs. Reid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Reid</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much, Mrs. Reid.</p>

<p>I will tell the Chief Justice of your cooperation and helpfulness.</p>

<p>We will reconvene at 2:30.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:35 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<h2 id="lm"><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
TESTIMONY OF LUKE MOONEY</h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2:15 p.m.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The purpose of today's hearing is to hear the testimony of
Officer Baker, whose testimony has been heard; Mrs. Reid, Eugene Boone, Luke
Mooney, and M.&nbsp;N. McDonald. Officer Baker and Mrs. Reid were in the vicinity
of the Texas School Book Depository Building at the time of the assassination.
Deputy Sheriffs Boone and Mooney assisted in the search of the sixth floor of
the Texas School Book Depository Building shortly after the assassination, and
Officer McDonald apprehended Lee Harvey Oswald at the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Officer Mooney, will you raise your right hand?</p>

<p>You do solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I do, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You are informed now of the nature and purpose of this
inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you appear here voluntarily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you have counsel with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you desire counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Mooney, what is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I am a deputy sheriff, Dallas County, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been in that job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I have been on the force since February 1, 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Hopkins County, south of Brashear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go to school there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I went to school at Middle Grove, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far did you go through school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I finished high school there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Well, I finished making a crop&mdash;I was a farm boy. My father
passed away. I started school at A. &amp; M. and had to withdraw after my father's
death, and come back home to my mother, because I was the only child at home.
And later on I took a course in aeronautical work, at Luscomb School of Aeronautics,
in Dallas, which is about&mdash;at that time was about 75 miles from my
home, and finished the course, and worked for Luscomb in Garland, Tex., which
is a suburb, or 15 miles out of Dallas.</p>

<p>And I worked there approximately a year before I was drafted into the U.S.
armed services. I was 19 years old when I was drafted, one of the first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long were you in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. From 1942&mdash;I went in December, I believe it was, 28th, 1942,
and got out February 20, 1946. I believe that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do then, after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I returned home on discharge, discharged out of the services,
honorable discharge. And I went to Dallas again, come back to Dallas.</p>

<p>After a short couple of weeks vacation, so to speak, I took a business course
at Drawns Business College in Dallas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
I finished the course there and was employed at Johnson Brothers Chevrolet
Co. for 10 years, approximately 10 years, as a dispatcher in the service department,
in charge of the shops. And for 2 years I worked for an automobile
financing company, Associate Investment Co.</p>

<p>And after 2 years of service there, I was employed by the Dallas County
Sheriff's Office, because I didn't desire to be transferred out of the city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work did you do for the sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I worked in the Writ and Execution Department, Civil Law,
Writ of Sequestrations and Executions. That is my principal job. However,
we do everything that comes down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you call that writ?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Writ of Sequestration, or you might call it sequest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was your job on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I didn't have a special assignment. Some of the officers did out
at the Market Hall. I was waiting in front of the Dallas Criminal Courts
Building, which is the sheriff's office, and we were waiting outside on the front
steps there. I was down on the sidewalk, off the steps, on the street level,
waiting for the motorcade to approach.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you standing there when the President went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. I took my hat off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. 505 Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is where the cavalcade turned north?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Made a right turn, yes, sir; on Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That building is about a block south on Houston, isn't it&mdash;south of
the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; it is a short block there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After the President's car went by, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Well, we were&mdash;we was more or less milling around. We just
kept standing there, more or less talking to one another.</p>

<p>I don't know how many seconds had elapsed&mdash;it wasn't too many.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say "we." Who was with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. There was another officer there, Hiram Ingram&mdash;he is an officer,
also, a deputy sheriff. And I believe Ralph Walters was standing there with me,
and I believe there was a lady standing there, by the name of Martha Johnson,
who is one of the judges' wife, a JP judge.</p>

<p>I believe Officer Boone was standing near us, also. And I don't recall how
many more. There was a number of officers there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened, as you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. After that few seconds elapsed, we heard this shot ring out.
At that time, I didn't realize it was a shot. The wind was blowing pretty high,
and, of course, it echoed. I turned my head this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean to the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. To the right; yes, sir. We were facing more or less south. And
I turned my head to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be looking towards Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Looking towards the old court.</p>

<p>Well, when I turned my head to the right; yes, sir. I would be looking west.
And there was a short lapse between these shots. I can still hear them very
distinctly&mdash;between the first and second shot. The second and third shot was
pretty close together, but there was a short lapse there between the first and
second shot. Why, I don't know. But when that begin to take place&mdash;after the
first shot we started moving out. And by the time I started running&mdash;all of us
except Officer Ingram&mdash;he had a heart attack, and, of course, he wasn't qualified
to do any running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Due west, across Houston Street, went down across this lawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
across Elm Street there&mdash;I assume it is approximately the location the President
was hit.</p>

<p>Of course the motorcade was gone. There wasn't anything there except a
bunch of people, a lot of them laying on the ground, taking on, various things.
I was running at full speed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you ran across Elm, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Across Elm, up the embankment, which is a high terrace there,
across&mdash;there is a kind of concrete building there, more or less of a little park.</p>

<p>Jumped over the fence and went into the railroad yards. And, of course, there
was other officers over there. Who they were, I don't recall at this time. But
Ralph Walters and I were running together. And we jumped into the railroad
yards and began to look around there.</p>

<p>And, of course, we didn't see anything there. Of course the other officers had
checked into the car there, and didn't find anything, I don't believe, but a Negro
porter. Of course there were quite a few spectators milling around behind us.
We were trying to clear the area out and get all the civilians out that wasn't
officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you go over to the railroad yard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Well, that was&mdash;from the echo of the shots, we thought they
came from that direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be north and west from where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. To a certain extent&mdash;northwest. The way the echo
sounded, the cracking of the shot. And we wasn't there many seconds&mdash;of course
I never did look at my watch to see how many seconds it took us to run so many
hundred yards there, and into the railroad yard. We were there only a few
seconds until we had orders to cover the Texas Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you get those orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. They were referred to us by the sheriff, Mr. Bill Decker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was he when he gave you those orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. They were relayed on to us. I assume Mr. Decker was up near
the intersection of Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear it over a loudspeaker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir. It come by word, by another officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were with Walters at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Right. And where Officer Walters went at that time, I don't
know. We split up. I didn't see him any more until later on, which I will refer
to later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Mr. Webster and Mr. Vickery were there with me at the time
that we received these orders from another deputy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They are deputy sheriffs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; they were plainclothes officers like myself, work in the
same department, and we run right over to the building then, which we were
only 150, 200 feet back&mdash;I assume it is that distance&mdash;I haven't measured it. It
didn't take us but a few seconds to get there. When we hit the rear part,
these big iron gates, they have cyclone fencing on them&mdash;this used to be an
old grocery store warehouse&mdash;Sachs &amp; Co., I believe is correct. And I says
let's get these doors closed to block off this rear entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the doors open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. They were wide open, the big gates. So I grabbed one, and we
swung them to, and there was a citizen there, and I put him on orders to
keep them shut, because I don't recall whether there was a lock on them or
not. Didn't want to lock them because you never know what might happen.</p>

<p>So he stood guard, I assume, until a uniformed officer took over.</p>

<p>We shut the back door&mdash;there was a back door on a little dock. And then
we went in through the docks, through the rear entrance.</p>

<p>Officer Vickery and Webster said, "We will take the staircase there in the
corner."</p>

<p>I said, "I will go up the freight elevator." I noticed there was a big
elevator there. So I jumped on it. And about that time two women come
running and said, "we want to go to the second floor."</p>

<p>I said, "All right, get on, we are going."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which elevator did you get on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. It was the one nearest to the staircase, on the northwest corner
of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There are two elevators there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I found that out later. I didn't know it at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took the west one, or the east one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I would say it was the west elevator, the one nearest to the
staircase.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it work with a push button?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. It was a push button affair the best I can remember. I
got hold of the controls and it worked. We started up and got to the
second. I was going to let them off and go on up. And when we got there,
the power undoubtedly cut off, because we had no more power on the elevator.
So I looked around their office there, just a short second or two, and then I
went up the staircase myself. And I met some other officers coming down,
plainclothes, and I believe they were deputy sheriffs. They were coming down
the staircase. But I kept going up. And how come I get off the sixth floor,
I don't know yet. But, anyway, I stopped on six, and didn't even know what
floor I was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I was alone at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any reason for you to go to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir. That is what I say. I don't know why. I just
stopped on that particular floor. I thought I was pretty close to the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any other officers on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I didn't see any at that time. I assume there had been other
officers up there. But I didn't see them. And I begin criss-crossing it, round
and round, through boxes, looking at open windows&mdash;some of them were open
over on the south side.</p>

<p>And I believe they had started laying some flooring up there.</p>

<p>I was checking the fire escapes. And criss-crossing back and forth. And
then I decided&mdash;I saw there was another floor. And I said I would go up.
So I went on up to the seventh floor. I approached Officers Webster and Vickery.
They were up there&mdash;in this little old stairway there that leads up into
the attic. So we climbed up in there and looked around right quick. We
didn't climb all the way into the attic, almost into it. We said this is too dark,
we have got to have floodlights, because we can't see. And so somebody made
a statement that they believed floodlights was on the way. And I later found
out that probably Officers Boone and Walters had gone after lights. I heard
that.</p>

<p>And so we looked around up there for a short time. And then I says I am
going back down on six.</p>

<p>At that time, some news reporter, or press, I don't know who he was&mdash;he was
coming up with a camera. Of course he wasn't taking any pictures. He was
just looking, too, I assume. So I went back down ahead of Officers Vickery and
Webster. They come in behind me down to the sixth floor.</p>

<p>I went straight across to the southeast corner of the building, and I saw all
these high boxes. Of course they were stacked all the way around over there.
And I squeezed between two. And the minute I squeezed between these two
stacks of boxes, I had to turn myself sideways to get in there&mdash;that is when I
saw the expended shells and the boxes that were stacked up looked to be a rest
for the weapon. And, also, there was a slight crease in the top box. Whether
the recoil made the crease or it was placed there before the shots were fired, I
don't know. But, anyway, there was a very slight crease in the box, where
the rifle could have lain&mdash;at the same angle that the shots were fired from.</p>

<p>So, at that time, I didn't lay my hands on anything, because I wanted to save
every evidence we could for fingerprints. So I leaned out the window, the same
window from which the shots were fired, looked down, and I saw Sheriff Bill
Decker and Captain Will Fritz standing right on the ground.</p>

<p>Well, so I hollered, or signaled&mdash;I hollered, I more or less hollered. I
whistled a time or two before I got anybody to see me. And yet they was all
looking that way, too&mdash;except the sheriff, they wasn't looking up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
And I told him to get the crime lab officers en route, that I had the location
spotted.</p>

<p>So I stood guard to see that no one disturbed anything until Captain Will Fritz
approached with his group of officers, city officers. At that time, of course,
when I hollered, of course Officers Vickery and Webster, they came across and
later on several other deputies&mdash;I believe Officers McCurley, A.&nbsp;D. McCurley, I
believe he came over. Where he came from&mdash;they was all en route up there,
I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you three pictures, Officer; for your convenience I will give
you the pictures.</p>

<p>I have a picture here which has been marked as Commission Exhibit 508.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 508 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that look anything like the southeast corner of the building
as you saw it that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of day was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Well, it was approaching 1 o'clock. It could have been 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look at your watch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir; I didn't. I should have, but I didn't look at my watch
at the time to see what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you the only officer in that corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. At that very moment I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you squeezed behind certain boxes. Can you point out
for me what boxes you squeezed through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. If I remember correctly, I went in there from this angle right
here&mdash;right through here. There could be a space. There is a space there I
squeezed in between here, and that is when I got into the opening, because the
minute I squeezed through there there lay the shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Let's make a mark here. Is this the space?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I believe that is going to be the space; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If I make an arrow on that, would that indicate it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. There is another picture I have seen later that shows
an opening in through here, but I didn't see that opening at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the opening through which you squeezed? And it is an
arrow shown on Exhibit 508.</p>

<p>Now, I will show you 509.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 509 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Is that the way the boxes looked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. That is the three boxes, but one of them was tilted off just a
little, laying down on the edge, I believe, to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, does that look <span class="locked">like&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. That is the three boxes that were there; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are they arranged as they were when you saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I am not positive. As I remember right, there was one box
tilted off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were the boxes&mdash;did they have a label on them, two of the
boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. These do. I didn't notice the label at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is a picture of the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do I understand that you say that it appeared to you that the top
box was tilted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. The end of it was laying this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say there was a crease in a box. Where was that crease?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. This crease was right in this area of this box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean over on the edge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; on this far ledge here, where I am laying my finger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it go into the box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Very slight crease, very slight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you take this and point out about where the crease was on
509?</p>

<p>Now, was there anything you saw over in the corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir; I didn't see anything over in the corner. I did see
this one partially eaten piece of fried chicken laying over to the right. It
looked like he was <span class="locked">facing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell us where you found it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. It would be laying over on the top of these other boxes. This
here is kind of blurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will get to that in a moment. Now, I show you 510.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 510 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the empty shells you found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are they shown there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, will you take this and encircle the shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a fairly good sized circle around each shell. That is the way
they were when you saw them, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. I assume that this possibly could have been the first
shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You cannot speculate about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. You cannot speculate about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Those were empty shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were turned over to Captain Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; he was the first officer that picked them up, as far
as I know, because I stood there and watched him go over and pick them up
and look at them. As far as I could tell, I couldn't even tell what caliber
they were, because I didn't get down that close to them. They were brass
cartridges, brass shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is this the position of the cartridges as shown on 510, as you saw
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. That is just about the way they were laying, to the
best of my knowledge. I do know there was&mdash;one was further away, and these
other two were relatively close together&mdash;on this particular area. But these
cartridges&mdash;this one and this one looks like they are further apart than they
actually was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which ones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. This one and this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, two cartridges were close together, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. The one cartridge here, by the wall facing, is right. And this
one and this one, they were further away from this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. But as to being positive of the exact <span class="locked">distance&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think that the cartridges are in the same position as when
you saw them in this picture 510?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. As far as my knowledge, they are; pretty close to right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, we will label these cartridges, the empty shells as "A", "B",
and "C."</p>

<p>Now, I didn't quite understand&mdash;did you say it was your memory that "A"
and "B" were not that close together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Just from my memory, it seems that this cartridge ought to
have been over this way a little further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the "B" cartridge should be closer to the "C?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Closer to the "C"; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I have another picture here which I should like to have
marked as 511.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 511 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does this appear to be&mdash;first of all, does that <span class="locked">appear&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. There are two cartridges.</p>

<p>Where is the third one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The third one is not in this picture. This is taken from another
angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. This looks more like it than this angle here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You can see it is a different angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in this same picture&mdash;511, you see a box in the window.
Does that seem to be about the <span class="locked">angle&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes; that box was tilted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was tilted in that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when you made a crease on 509, the box shown in <span class="locked">509&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. The box should have been actually tilted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, it was your testimony, was it, that the box as shown
in 509 was not as you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. If I recall it right, this box was tilted. It had fallen off&mdash;looked
like he might have knocked it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you cannot speculate to that, but you can just tell us what
you saw. What about the box in the window shown in 511?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the box that had the crease on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; I believe that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the crease was&mdash;started from the edge, and came across?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; just a slight crease.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have another picture. This is 512.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 512 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is a picture taken, also, from another angle. Does that
show the cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, compare that with 510.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that about the way it looked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; that is right. It sure is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, were the boxes, as you saw them, on the extreme left side
of the window, the middle of the window, or the right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Well, they were further over to the left of the window than
over to the right. More or less as they are in there in that picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In 509?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the boxes are in about the right position with reference
<span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; because I had room enough to stand right here, and
lean out this window, without disturbing the boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You could stand on the right of the boxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And put your head out the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. If I recall, I put my hand on the outside of this ledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And put your head out the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was the window open when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If you stood to the left of the boxes, could you have looked out
the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I don't believe I could, without disturbing them. Possibly I
might have, could have, but I just didn't try it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I show you Exhibit 513.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 513, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is another view of that window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see it from that angle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't think you have ever seen <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. From that angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that show any place where you saw the chicken bone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. If I recall correctly, the chicken bone could have been laying
on this box or it might have been laying on this box right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Make a couple of marks there to indicate where possibly the
chicken bone was lying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Make two "X's". You think there was a chicken bone on the top
of either one of those two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. There was one of them partially eaten. And there was a little
small paper poke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By poke, you mean a paper sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Saw the chicken bone was laying here. The poke was laying
about a foot away from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the same carton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. In close relation to each other. But as to what was
in the sack&mdash;it was kind of together, and I didn't open it. I didn't put my
hands on it to open it. I only saw one piece of chicken.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How far was the chicken, the piece of chicken you saw, and
the paper bag from the boxes near the window, and particularly the box
that had the crease in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I would say they might have been 5 feet or something like that.
He wouldn't have had to leave the location. He could just maybe take one
step and lay it over there, if he was the one that put it there.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You mean if someone had been standing near the box with
the crease in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. It would have been that approximate distance to the chicken
leg and paper bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And the paper bag you spoke of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; they were in close relation to each other, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How big a bag was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Well, as to the number&mdash;these bags are numbered, I understand.
But it was&mdash;I don't know what the number you would call it, but it didn't
stand more than that high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About 12 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. About 8 to 10 inches, at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What color was the bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. It was brown. Just a regular paper bag. Just as a grocery
store uses for their produce and what-have-you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any soda pop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a paper bag at any other window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any other chicken bones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a Dr. Pepper bottle any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir; except in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you say you have seen the picture, I will show you the
picture, and let me see if that is the one you mean you have seen. That is
Commission 484. This picture has been shown to you, hasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I showed you that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you did not see that two-wheel truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did not see the Dr. Pepper bottle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't see a paper sack anywhere near a two-wheel truck or a
Dr. Pepper bottle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir; in my running around up there, I didn't observe it.
Possibly it was there. I am sure it was. But I didn't check it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay up on the sixth floor? After you found
the location of the three cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Well, I stayed up there not over 15 or 20 minutes longer&mdash;after
Captain Will Fritz and his officers came over there, Captain Fritz picked
up the cartridges, began to examine them, of course I left that particular area.
By that time there was a number of officers up there. The floor was covered
with officers, And we were searching, trying to find the weapon at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you there when it was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. I was searching under these books and between them
and up on the ledges and the joists, we was just looking everywhere. And I
was about 10 or 15 steps at the most from Officer Boone when he hollered,
"Here is the gun."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I stepped over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I had to look twice before I actually saw the gun laying in
there. I had to get around to the right angle before I could see it. And there
the gun lay, stuck between these cartons in an upright position. The scope
was up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, now, I will show you a picture, 514.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 514, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask&mdash;did you change the position of the shells which
you have identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir; I didn't have my hands on them.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Or the bag, or chicken leg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Until&mdash;before the chief came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Captain Will Fritz; yes, sir; he is the chief.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was there any odor in the area when you first got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. I didn't particularly notice any. Now, there could have been
a slight powder odor there.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Warren entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you smell any powder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge. Of course it was musty odor,
with all those cartons and books there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you see the picture which is 514? Does it look like anything
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; with the exception there was more cartons around
it than that. In other words, the way it looked to me, when I walked over
there&mdash;of course these may have been disturbed at a later date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It looks like there are more cartons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. No; there is less cartons around it right now. Of course that
is looking straight down. Now, there are some more boxes here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a picture which we will mark as 515.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 515 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. But that is in the position the gun was laying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is about the position of the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, here is a picture of that marked stairway. Can you orient
yourself from that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Let's see. Here is the staircase right in here. If I remember
right, the gun was either in this crack or this one here. I don't remember
which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that show you about the number of cartons around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir; that is the way it looked; sure did. Because I had
to stand up back here, before I could see over off in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when you did look down there between the cartons, was the
<span class="locked">gun&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. It was sitting in that position. The scope was up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As shown in 514?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. That is the way it was laying, in that position.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. It was lying on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. With the scope on the upper side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. The scope in upright position. The stock was back to the east.
In other words, the gun was pointed west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did a photographer come up and take pictures when you were
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. There was a number of photographers up there shooting pictures.
Who they were or who they represented&mdash;I assume it was the press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long were they there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. They were there when all these officers and everybody was up
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. How far was it from the place where the gun was found,
from where you first saw the rifle, to the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. You mean how far was it from the gun to the window?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes; where you saw the shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Well, it was clear across the entire sixth floor, thereabouts. In
other words, if you take the location from where the shells were found, they
were in the southeast corner. And this was in the far northwest corner. Just
right there at the staircase.</p>

<p>And the distance across there, I just don't know how far it is, but it is quite
a large warehouse floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions. I would like to offer the exhibits up
to 515, inclusive. May this witness be excused?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Any questions, Senator Cooper?</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. As you examined these exhibits, you gave your best judgment,
your recollection of the location of the boxes and the shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. The way I remember, sir, <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The chicken and the paper bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. I do remember that the one box was tilted off, laying
partially over on the legs.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That was the box which you said you observed a crease in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. Yes, sir. Just very slight, very slight.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Is that the box which was the top box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. The way I remember, the two boxes and the third one was the
one tilted off. It looked like it possibly could have been knocked off from a
movement, because it wasn't naturally placed that way by hand for any purpose,
because it wouldn't have had any purpose, to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Let the exhibits which have been offered be admitted in
evidence.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 508 through 515, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mooney</span>. In other words, if you just run against it, you would have
knocked it off.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much for coming, sir. You have been very
helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Our next witness is Deputy Sheriff Boone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<h2 id="eb">TESTIMONY OF EUGENE BOONE</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Sit right down, Mr. Boone.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. The purpose of this hearing is to hear the testimony of
M.&nbsp;L. Baker, Mrs. R.&nbsp;A. Reid, Eugene Boone, Luke Mooney, and M.&nbsp;N. McDonald.
Officer Baker and Mrs. Reid were in the vicinity of the Texas School Book
Depository Building at the time of the assassination. Deputy Sheriffs Boone
and Mooney assisted in the search of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository Building shortly after the assassination, and Officer McDonald apprehended
Lee Harvey Oswald at the Texas theatre.</p>

<p>Will you be sworn? Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to
give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You understand the purpose of this inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You have come here voluntarily to testify?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you have a counsel with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you desire one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I am a deputy sheriff in or for the county of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been a deputy sheriff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. A year and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go to school there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far through school did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. High school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after you got out of school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I was working with the Dallas Times Herald Newspaper there,
in the advertising department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you work there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Well, I worked there part time when I was going to school, up
until the time I quit, 8 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the time you went with the sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Twenty-six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d of November, where were you working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I was working downtown. I was out viewing the parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you view the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Right in front of the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you been assigned a place, a job that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were out in front of the sheriff's office on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Near Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who were you with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Officer Mooney was out there, I believe, and several of the office
personnel, women in the office, clerk-typist and what-have-you. Ralph Walters,
Buddy Walthers, Allen Sweatt, L.&nbsp;C. Smith. Officer Gramstaff. That is about
all I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Well, it was approximately 1 o'clock when we heard the shots.
The motorcade had already passed by us and turned back to the north on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Houston Street. And we heard what we thought to be a shot. And there
seemed to be a pause between the first shot and the second shot and third shots&mdash;a
little longer pause. And we raced across the street there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You raced across what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You turned to your right and went west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Well, there is a big cement works out there. We went on west
across Houston Street, and then cut across the grass out there behind the
large cement works there. Some of the bystanders over there seemed to think
the shots came from up over the railroad in the freight yards, from over the
triple underpass.</p>

<p>So there was some city officer, I don't know who he was, motorcycle officer
had laid his motorcycle down and was running up the embankment to get over
a little retaining wall that separates the freight yards there. He went over
the wall first, and I was right behind him, going into the freight yards. We
searched out the freight yards. We were unable to find anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A good many officers over there searching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes; there were. Most all of the officers&mdash;well, all of the officers
in front of the sheriff's office there. There were others that I don't recall.
There were other officers in the area. Also, they all ran in that general direction,
over around the depository and also down into the freight yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any railroad employees around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. There was one colored boy way on back down in the freight
yards. He had been working on one of the pullmans down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And didn't you talk to somebody that was also in a tower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A man named Bowers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I don't know what his name was. He was up in the tower and
I hollered up there to see if he had seen anybody running out there in the
freight yards, or heard any shots. And he said he didn't hear any shots,
and he hadn't seen anybody racing around out there in the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was a railroad tower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes; it is situated between the tracks and the school book
depository. Almost directly west of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After that, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Well, I finally went around and was talking to some of the
spectators that were in the area there, located a boy by the name of Betzer.
He had taken what he thought was some photographs, or there were photographs&mdash;he
thought he might have had a portion of the building.</p>

<p>Later on we were able to ascertain that the shots had come from the building,
from that southeast corner over there. And he had some photographs, but they
didn't extend past the second floor on the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go up into the building then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I took him on over to the sheriff's office, and placed him in the
sheriff's office, took his camera, to bring it back to the ID Bureau to be developed.
Placed him in the sheriff's office at that time to await somebody to
take a statement from him.</p>

<p>Then some other officers, Ralph Walters and Officer Gramstaff, and I don't
know whether&mdash;I don't remember Officer Mooney was with them or not at that
time&mdash;they headed back to get some heavy power flashlights. They said they
wanted to look around in the attic. And there were a bunch of pallets, that
they moved the books around, and it was dark and they couldn't see. So we
got the lights and went over to the building.</p>

<p>At that time, we proceeded directly to the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Somebody tell you to go to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Well, that is just where everybody was going. And they said
five floors below that&mdash;I believe Inspector Sawyer with the city was out there,
and he said the other floors were in the process of being searched or had been
already searched. This was after Officer Mooney found the shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did somebody tell you Officer Mooney had found some shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Not him in particular. They said the shells had been found on
the sixth floor. At that time, I didn't know he had found them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after you got up to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Well, I proceeded to the east end of the building, I guess, and
started working our way across the building to the west wall, looking in, under,
and around all the boxes and pallets, and what-have-you that were on the floor.
Looking for the weapon. And as I got to the west wall, there were a row of
windows there, and a slight space between some boxes and the wall. I squeezed
through them.</p>

<p>When I did&mdash;I had my light in my hand. I was slinging it around on the
floor, and I caught a glimpse of the rifle, stuffed down between two rows of
boxes with another box or so pulled over the top of it. And I hollered that the
rifle was here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Some of the other officers came over to look at it. I told them
to stand back, not to get around close, they might want to take prints of some
of the boxes, and not touch the rifle. And at that time Captain Fritz and an
ID man came over. I believe the ID man's name was Lieutenant Day&mdash;I am
not sure. They came over and the weapon was photographed as it lay. And
at that time Captain Fritz picked it up by the strap, and it was removed from
the place where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw them take the photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you alone at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. There was an Officer Weitzman, I believe. He is a deputy
constable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the rifle located on the floor, general location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Well, it was almost&mdash;the stairwell is in the corner of the building,
something like this, and there is a wall coming up here, making one side of the
stairwell with the building acting as the other two sides. And from that,
it was almost directly in front or about 3 feet south, I guess, it would be, from
that partition wall that made up the stairwell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The rifle was about 3 feet from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, sir; behind a row of boxes. There was a row of boxes that
came across there. Then the rifle was behind that first row of boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you 514. Is that the way it looked when you saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the way it was when the picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This shows the rifle as you saw it, does it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. That is right. Then you could kneel down over here and see
that it had a scope, a telescopic sight on it, by looking down underneath the
boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I show you 515. Does that look anything like the area
where you found the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you put that down on the table so that everyone can see
where it is, and show us where the rifle was with reference to the stairwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. This is that retaining wall here that I was talking about here.
Now, the rifle was right down in this area right here, almost directly. This is the
west end of the building here, this being the north side, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the northwest corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes. And it is about 3 feet from the edge&mdash;you cannot see the
edge of it because it is behind this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The edge of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. The stairwell wall here. It is about 3 feet from where this
partition ends over to&mdash;back behind these cases of books here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you mark with an arrow there the exact space between the
boxes where you found the rifle as shown on this exhibit, which is 514?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. What do you mean&mdash;the exact space? It was in this space right
in here, like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The arrow marks the space.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I had come around these boxes here, next to the windows over
here, and that is when I saw it, looking down across this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You came along the west wall, near the windows shown in this
picture 514?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when you looked in the direction that would be easterly,
that is when you saw the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Northeasterly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is another picture which we will mark as 516.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 516 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, 515 contains the arrow which shows the space between boxes
where you found the rifle, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I show you an exhibit marked 516. Does that show&mdash;what
corner of the building does that show? Or do you recognize it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. It appears to be the same general location here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Show&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. This is the stairwell back here in the corner. If I am not mistaken,
there is a freight elevator over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be the right of the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, point to the boxes where you found the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Right down in this general direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Draw another arrow. I show you Exhibit 483, a diagram of the
sixth floor. Now, by referring to these numbers, can you show us approximately
where the rifle was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Roughly in the area here, designated by the arrow No. 35.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The diagram on the sixth floor, as the Commission knows, has
been correlated with certain pictures. I now have Commission Exhibit 517
marked, which has the figure 35 on it, which corresponds to the position of the
camera at the time the picture was taken.</p>

<p>In other words, at about point 35 on this map. And now I show you a photograph
marked 517. Is that about the way the rifle looked when you first
saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes; it is. There was some newsman up there right behind
Officer Whitman and myself who took movie film of it, too. I don't know
his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. 1:22 p.m., in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 1:22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You looked at your watch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And made a note of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a rifle which is Commission Exhibit 139. Can you tell
us whether or not that looks like the rifle you saw on the floor that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. It looks like the same rifle. I have no way of being positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You never handled it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I did not touch the weapon at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to offer all the exhibits we have offered with this
witness, which is 515 to 516 and 517, into evidence.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Let the exhibits be admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 515, 516, and
517 were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think you said that the reason you didn't touch it was
because of the danger of fingerprints on there, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. That is correct. The city officers had personnel in charge up
there. Captain Fritz, I believe, was in charge, senior officer on the floor.</p>

<p>He was called to the location as soon as I found the rifle. He came over, and
it was photographed then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you notice whether the rifle that you discovered had a
telescopic sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, it did.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did it have a sling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, it did. Because Captain Fritz picked it up by the sling
when he removed it from its resting place.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Looking at Exhibit 483, which represents the floor plan of
the sixth floor, you have marked on there the place where you found the rifle.
Is that near the stairwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, sir; this is the stairwell right here in the northeast corner.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Also near the elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon me, Senator Cooper, I think you said northeast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Northwest&mdash;I beg your pardon.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you remember whether Officer Mooney came up after you
found the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I don't recall. There were officers, both city and county officers,
and constables officers up in the area on the floor. Now, whether he was among
the crowd there, I do not know.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. When you climbed over the retaining wall at the railroad
yard, can you describe what the situation in the railroad yard was at that time?
Were there railroad cars in the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. There were four railroad cars down approximately 100 yards
from the retaining wall, right over the Elm Street tunnel, or portion of the
triple underpass. Then there were some people down to the south of the triple
underpass which had viewed the parade, or were viewing the parade&mdash;I don't
know. The city officer went back south, as I recall, and I went off to the north,
northwest.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Sheriff, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is one question. Did you hear anybody refer to this rifle
as a Mauser that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. Yes, I did. And at first, not knowing what it was, I thought it
was 7.65 Mauser.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who referred to it as a Mauser that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boone</span>. I believe Captain Fritz. He had knelt down there to look at it,
and before he removed it, not knowing what it was, he said that is what it looks
like. This is when Lieutenant Day, I believe his name is, the ID man was getting
ready to photograph it.</p>

<p>We were just discussing it back and forth. And he said it looks like a 7.65
Mauser.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much, Sheriff. You have been very helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Call Officer McDonald.</p>

<h2 id="mnm">TESTIMONY OF M. N. McDONALD</h2>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Will you stand up and be sworn? Do you swear that the
testimony you shall give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You understand that the purpose of this inquiry is to inquire
into the circumstances surrounding the assassination of the late President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Today's hearings are to hear testimony of various witnesses,
including yourself, who were in the vicinity of the Texas School Book Depository
Building at the time of the assassination, and because it is reported you apprehended
Lee Harvey Oswald in the Texas theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you testify here voluntarily?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you have counsel with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do you desire counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. McDonald, where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. 530 South Port Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Camden, Ark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go to school in Arkansas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far through school did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, I finished through the 11th grade, took an equivalent for
a high school diploma, and I attended 1 year at Arkansas State Teachers College
in Conway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What year was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. 1948 and 1949.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, worked in a printing firm for awhile, after getting out
of college a year. Then I joined the Air Force. But in a break between high
school and college, I entered the Navy, in January 1946. I served 22 months in
the Navy, active duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you say in the 1950's you joined the Air Force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; December 29, 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long were you in the Air Force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Four years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What work did you do in the Air Force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I was a supply sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After that, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I became a policeman in the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was in 1956?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. March 3, 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you have been a police officer ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you on duty on March&mdash;November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was your job that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Radio patrol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were your hours of duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. From 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ride alone or have a partner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir; I had a partner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. T. R. Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you cruising about 12:30 that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In what area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. On the Westmoreland Avenue and Falls Drive intersection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was your area, an area close to downtown Dallas or outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Outside, approximately 8 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you get an order over the radio about that time to move your
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Report to the vicinity of Elm and Houston Streets, code 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you know Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he also a radio patrol officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he cruise alone or with a partner?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. He was cruising alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what his area&mdash;the area assigned to him on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. The southern part of Oak Cliff, nearing the city limits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that farther out from the center of town than you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; approximately 10 to 12 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Tippit usually cruise alone, or did he ever have a partner
sometimes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, working in the daylight hours, which we were assigned
that month, it is a custom to work alone&mdash;unless he had a trainee, such as I.
I don't believe he was a trainer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you had a trainee with you, and that is the reason
you were not alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear an order over the radio for cars in the outlying district
near the city limits, what they were to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. They were to move in closer to the downtown area, but not
directly to the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were ordered to move into the downtown area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the cars that were cruising farther out were ordered to move
closer to the downtown area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear any other specific orders over the radio that day&mdash;that
morning, or about 12:30, 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after you received those orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I applied my red lights and sirens, and went code 32, Elm
and Houston Streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Approximately 10 minutes later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Approximately 12:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you park your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. On the right curb, Elm Street, before you enter the triple
underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Approximately 35 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were you doing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, after I left the car, my partner and I reported to a
supervisor, and he directed us to patrol the crowd and move the crowd around
Elm Street, and rope off the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, was your radio on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. There were several police units around the intersection,
and all the radios were on. And after I had moved the crowd around,
went back to the entrance of the Texas School Book Depository, I heard this
over the police radio, of&mdash;the first thing I heard was that President Kennedy
had expired at Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>And the next thing I heard was a voice over the radio that was not familiar
to police procedure. He was saying that an officer had been shot, and that he
was using car No. 10 radio. Of my own knowledge, I knew that car was driven by
Officer Tippit, and that that car was assigned to his district.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he give you a location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; 400 block of East 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I told my partner we were not doing much good here, to go
to Oak Cliff, and see if we could help out over there, try to apprehend the person
that shot Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go in Oak Cliff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, we got in the car and went underneath the triple underpass
and got on the Stemmons Expressway, which leads into the R.&nbsp;L. Thornton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Expressway. I believe we took the Jefferson exit and drove up to the 400 block
of East Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Patton is about a block to the north of Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Patton runs across Jefferson. Tenth and Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Patton runs north and south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tenth Street is a block north of Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to go to the 400 block on Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I was stopped by other officers there. They wanted to search
a house. So I relieved my partner to go to help the supervisors search this
house, in the 400 block of East Jefferson. Then I went around to the alleys, and
started cruising the alley in my squad car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you get a call over your radio to go to a certain place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, there was a report from the dispatcher that a suspect
was seen running into the public library at Marsalis and Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. I went directly to Denver Street, which is an alley
at that point. It is still designated as Denver Street. I parked the squad car,
took my shotgun, and went to the west basement entrance to the public library,
and ordered the people in the basement, in the library outside. They came out
with their hands up.</p>

<p>The boy immediately said that he had just run into the library to tell the
people that the President had been shot. He was a much younger person than
what was broadcast on description on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had heard a broadcast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of a description, of someone to look for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. White male, approximately 27 years old, 5 foot 10, weight
about 145 pounds, wearing light clothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you hear that? About what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. It came out on the radio as I was coming to Oak Cliff. There
was another general description given on the way to the Texas School Book
Depository at Elm and Houston Streets. But it was a vague description.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The first description that you heard of a man to look for was on
the way downtown to the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was that description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. White male, approximately 27, 29 years old, and he had a
white shirt on, weighed about 160 pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that was about 12:40 you got that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this later description you got was what point in your travel
to Oak Cliff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. This was approximately 1:20, or 1:17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was after you had heard that Tippit&mdash;that the officer had
been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was that description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, it was 5 foot 10, white male, 27 years old, wearing a
white shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, as you were cruising the alleys, you had gone into the library
basement, and gone to cruising the alleys, did you hear something else over
the radio that drew your attention to another <span class="locked">part&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Just to report to the public library.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After that. Did you receive a report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. After I was satisfied that this teenager that had run into
the library didn't fit the description, I went back to my squad car, put my
shotgun back in the rack. Just as I got into the squad car, it was reported
that a suspect was seen running into the Texas Theatre, 231 West Jefferson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
So I reported to that location Code 3. This is approximately seven blocks
from the library, seven blocks west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down there with your partner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir; I had let my partner out on arrival; my first arrival
in the 400 block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was on foot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; I didn't see him any more that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went down to the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that is what address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. 231 West Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, when I got to the front of the theater there was several
police cars already at the scene, and I surmised that officers were already inside
the theater.</p>

<p>So I decided to go to the rear, in the alley, and seal off the rear. I parked my
squad car. I noticed there were three or four other officers standing outside
with shotguns guarding the rear exits. There were three other officers at the
rear door. I joined them. We walked into the rear exit door over the alley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Officer Hawkins, T.&nbsp;A. Hutson, and C.&nbsp;T. Walker. And as
we got inside the door, we were met by a man that was in civilian clothes, a
suit, and he told us that the man that acted suspiciously as he ran into the
theater was sitting downstairs in the orchestra seats, and not in the balcony.
He was sitting at the rear of the theater alone.</p>

<p>Officer Walker and I went to the exit curtains that is to the left of the movie
screen. I looked into the audience. I saw the person that the shoe store salesman
had pointed out to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the lights on or off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. The lights were up, and the movie was playing at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And could you see to the rear of the theater?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You could see the man. Did the civilian point out to you the
man in one of the rear seats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. He didn't point out personally. He was pointing out the
suspect to another officer with him on the right of the stage, just right of the
movie screen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, after seeing him, I noticed the other people in the
theater&mdash;there was approximately 10 or 15 other people seated throughout the
theater. There were two men sitting in the center, about 10 rows from the
front.</p>

<p>I walked up the left center aisle into the row behind these two men, and
Officer C.&nbsp;T. Walker was behind me. When I got to these two men, I told them
to get on their feet. They got up. I searched them for a weapon.</p>

<p>I looked over my shoulder and the suspect that had been pointed out to me.
He remained seated without moving, just looking at me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you frisk these two men in the center of the theater?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I wanted to make sure that I didn't pass anything or miss
anybody. I wanted to make sure I didn't overlook anybody or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you still kept your eye on the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. He was to my back. I was looking over my shoulder
at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he sitting nearest the right or the left aisle as you came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. The right center aisle. He was in the second seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. After I was satisfied that these two men were not armed or
had a weapon on them, I walked out of this row, up to the right center aisle
toward the suspect. And as I walked up there, just at a normal gait, I didn't
look directly at him, but I kept my eye on him and any other persons. And to
my left was another man and I believe a woman was with him. But he was
further back than the suspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
And just as I got to the row where the suspect was sitting, I stopped abruptly,
and turned in and told him to get on his feet. He rose immediately, bringing
up both hands. He got this hand about shoulder high, his left hand shoulder
high, and he got his right hand about breast high. He said, "Well, it is all over
now."</p>

<p>As he said this, I put my left hand on his waist and then his hand went to the
waist. And this hand struck me between the eyes on the bridge of the nose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he cock his fist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; knocking my cap off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which fist did he hit you with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. His left fist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, whenever he knocked my hat off, any normal reaction
was for me to go at him with this hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes. I went at him with this hand, and I believe I struck him
on the face, but I don't know where. And with my hand, that was on his hand
over the pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you feel the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which hand was&mdash;was his right hand or his left hand on the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. His right hand was on the pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And which of your hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. My left hand, at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And had he withdrawn the <span class="locked">pistol&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. He was drawing it as I put my hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From his waist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, whenever I hit him, we both fell into the seats. While
we were struggling around there, with this hand on the <span class="locked">gun&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your left hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. Somehow I managed to get this hand in the action
also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. Now, as we fell into the seats, I called out, "I have
got him," and Officer T.&nbsp;A. Hutson, he came to the row behind us and grabbed
Oswald around the neck. And then Officer C.&nbsp;T. Walker came into the row that
we were in and grabbed his left arm. And Officer Ray Hawkins came to the row
in front of us and grabbed him from the front.</p>

<p>By the time all three of these officers had got there, I had gotten my right
hand on the butt of the pistol and jerked it free.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you felt any movement of the hammer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. When this hand&mdash;we went down into the seats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When your left hand went into the seats, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. It felt like something had grazed across my hand. I felt
movement there. And that was the only movement I felt. And I heard a snap.
I didn't know what it was at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the pistol out of his waist at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know any way it was pointed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, I believe the muzzle was toward me, because the sensation
came across this way. To make a movement like that, it would have to be
the cylinder or the hammer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Across your left palm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. And my hand was directly over the pistol in this
manner. More or less the butt. But not on the butt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened when you jerked the pistol free?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. When I jerked it free, I was down in the seats with him, with
my head, some reason or other, I don't know why, and when I brought the
pistol out, it grazed me across the cheek here, and I put it all the way out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
the aisle, holding it by the butt. I gave the pistol to Detective Bob Carroll at
that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Grazed your left cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Scratched&mdash;noticeable scratch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; about a 4-inch scratch just above the eye to just
above the lip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, the officers that had come to my aid started handcuffing
him and taking him out of the theater.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say&mdash;anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, he was cursing a little bit and hollering police brutality,
for one thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What words did he use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I couldn't recall the exact words. It was just mixed up words,
people hollering and screaming when they get arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say about police brutality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. One thing, "Don't hit me any more." I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did somebody hit him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; I guess they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who hit him, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir; I don't, other than myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You know you hit him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you go with them outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I was looking for my hat and flashlight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go downtown with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Later you went downtown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you put a mark on the revolver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you look at the ammunition in the revolver, the six rounds
in the cylinder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice anything unusual about any one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I noticed on the primer of one of the shells it had an indentation
on it, but not one that had been fired or anything&mdash;not that strong of
an indentation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have here Exhibit 143 for identification. Do you know whether
or not this is the revolver that you took from the man that you arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; this is it. I found the mark here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You found your mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What mark is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I marked the initial "M".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Right here, on this steel plate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of the butt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let the record show the witness is pointing to a point on the steel
plate directly below the screw on the butt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many cartridges were in the cylinder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Six, fully loaded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you four that are marked as&mdash;we will give these four
an exhibit number. Do you know whether or not they were shells similar to
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; they were .38 caliber. Now, I didn't mark all of
these shells, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you mark any of them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I recall marking one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The four cartridges, the witness is examining now we will mark
collectively as Commission Exhibit 518.</p>

<p>(The articles referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 518 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And there are two cartridges that have been marked as Commission
Exhibit 145 that the witness is also examining. Now, on one of the
cartridges that have come from Commission's Exhibit 145, consisting of two
cartridges, one of these you identify as a cartridge with a dent in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How can you tell this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. From the center of this&mdash;of the primer there&mdash;it is a small
indentation, and some of the metal is blurred or not polished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And your mark is on one of these cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you an Exhibit 519.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 519 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that a picture of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And can you mark on there the seat in which the man was seated
who was the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put an arrow down to that seat. Did you see Oswald later that
evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you saw Oswald, was he bloody any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, when he was being taken from the theatre. Was he bloody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir; I didn't see any blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Because whenever they took him, they took him directly out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you never saw him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he wearing at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. At the time he was wearing a dark brown shirt and a T-shirt
and dark trousers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A dark brown shirt, a T-shirt, and dark trousers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you Commission 150. Does that look anything like the
color of the shirt he was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to at this time offer all exhibits up to 519 in evidence.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. They will be admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 518 and 519 were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice where the pistol was concealed on this man's
person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. It was under his right waist band, right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it under the shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; it was underneath the shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Underneath the shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. I would like to correct that, and say it was underneath
the brown shirt that he had on. Not underneath the T-shirt.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It was not in a holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir; no holster at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were&mdash;was there an FBI agent there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I don't know, sir. I was told he was there, but I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The only people that you saw <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. The ones I named there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Dallas Police Department men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Who was it that pointed out to you the suspect when you
entered the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I learned his name later.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did some person there point out to you, though, this man
sitting in the row whom you later arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. He was a shoestore salesman. His name was
Brewer. He was the one that met us at the rear exit door and said that he
saw this person run into the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you hear him say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. And have you seen him since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But somebody has identified him to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will examine him next week, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask&mdash;if the suspect was pointed out to you, why was
it you did not go directly to him, but you searched other persons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, usually on information of that sort, you have to weigh
it a little bit to make sure you get the right person. He could have been mistaken.
If a suspect was in that theatre, I wanted to make sure I got him,
and not overlook him.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You said, though, that before you went into the theatre,
where the seats were located, that a man pointed out to you a person who
he claimed was the suspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; he said that that was the man that had acted
suspiciously in running into the theatre.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That was the man that was identified to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Then, if he was the man identified to you, why did you stop
and search these two men before you got to the man you later arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, I wanted to make sure he was right.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Was it your purpose to search everybody in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. It was my intention&mdash;everybody I came to.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were these the first two that you did search?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; they were the closest ones to me.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. They were sitting in front of the man you later arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir; they were sitting about 10 rows in front of him.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. At the time you were searching them, you could see the other
man that you later arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Just sat in his seat, with his hands in his lap, watching me.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Were there any other police officers in his vicinity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. There were police officers in the balcony, and police officers in
the aisle, or in the lobby, you might call it&mdash;not in the theatre, except for the
other three that I named.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You are the only one in the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, there was the other three officers that accompanied me
through the rear exit door. Officer Walker went through the curtains with me,
and Officers Hawkins and Hutson was on the stage with the man that was identifying
the suspect.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Then when you told the man you arrested to stand up
did he immediately pull his pistol out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir; he stood up and started raising his hands, "Well,
it is all over now." But in my opinion, it was an act of giving up or surrendering.
It was just natural that my hand went to his waist for a weapon,
which was my intent anyway, whether he raised his hands or not. I didn't
command him to raise his hands or anything. It was just a reaction of his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he hit you with the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he point it towards you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. I don't know what position the gun was pointed out, whenever
my hand was on it, because we were both grappling around there. But, as
I say, the top of my hand was over on top of the pistol.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. To whom did you turn over the possession of the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Detective Bob Carroll. He had come into the aisle. Whenever
I hollered, "I got him" immediately I was swarmed by officers.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did you mark the pistol at that time before you turned it
over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. No, sir; I marked it at the police station.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. But you recognized it then as the same pistol you had
identified today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Officer, you were in uniform that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Did the blow he gave you on your nose leave any mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Well, for 2 days I had some swelling. It didn't break the
skin or anything. Some of the force was taken by my top. It hit the bill of
my cap and my nose.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And the scratch from the corner of your eye down to the
corner of your mouth came from the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir. As I was taking the pistol away, clearing it
from his body. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think that is all. We are very glad you are able to be with
us today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is one thing.</p>

<p>I have marked an exhibit, 520.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 520 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As he said he had not seen Oswald since, and I know this was
taken&mdash;but I would like to ask him one question with reference to 520 for
identification, and we will later provide an identification, proper identification
for it.</p>

<p>Does that look like the man that you arrested in the Texas Theatre that
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And does it look like&mdash;well, of course, he had a shirt over that
T-shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McDonald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much, officer. We are glad you were able
to be with us.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 4:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

a few questions like that.</p>

<p>Take it easy, this is <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I am very shook up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is a very informal little conference here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, do you want me to tell you about my life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes. Just tell us briefly where you were born and where you went
to school and things of that kind.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was born in Dallas, Dallas County. My father was a
farmer. I was very small when my mother died, I was 6 years old; and my
brothers and I were separated which they were put in the State orphans home,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have done waitress work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where do you work now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Eat Well Restaurant, 1404 Main Street, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you working there on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What hours did you work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was due at work from 2:30 in the evening until 10:30
at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Straight shift?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you leave your home some time that morning to go to work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You left your home to go to work at some time, didn't you, that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. At one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One o'clock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I believe it was a little after 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you intend to catch the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. On Patton and Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Patton and Jefferson is about a block south of Patton and 10th
Street, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, where is your home from Patton and Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I had came&mdash;I come one block, I had come one block from
my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were walking, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I came from 9th to the corner of 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were walking toward Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tenth Street runs the same direction as Jefferson, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It runs in a generally east and west direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Patton runs north and south?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; up and down this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So you were walking south toward Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think it was a little after 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I wouldn't be afraid to bet it wasn't 6 or 7 minutes after 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You know what time you usually get your bus, don't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. 1:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So it was before 1:15?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you came to the corner of Patton and 10th Street&mdash;first of
all, what side of the street were you walking on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Now you have got me mixed up on all my streets. I was on
the opposite of where this man was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you were walking along the <span class="locked">street&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. On the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Patton, you were going toward Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were on the right- or left-hand side of the street as you
were walking south?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That would be on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, it would be right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right-hand side, wouldn't it? When you came to the corner did
you have to stop before you crossed 10th Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. On account the traffic was coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you stopped there on the corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be the northwest corner, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Northwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I believe it is. I believe it is the northwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any man walking at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; I seen this man on the opposite side, across the street
from me. He was almost across Patton Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Almost across Patton?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Walking in what direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I guess this would be south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Along 10th, east? Was it along 10th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Walking away from you, wasn't he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He was walking up 10th, away from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To your left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, he was on the opposite side of the street to me like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had he reached the curb yet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Almost ready to get up on the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you notice then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, I noticed a police car coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the police car when you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He was driving real slow, almost up to this man, well, say
this man, and he kept, this man kept walking, you know, and the police car
going real slow now, real slow, and they just kept coming into the curb, and
finally they got way up there a little ways up, well, it stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The police car stopped?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the man? Was he still walking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. The man stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you see the man do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I saw the man come over to the car very slow, leaned and put
his arms just like this, he leaned over in this window and looked in this window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He put his arms on the window ledge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. The window was down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put his arms on the window ledge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. On the ledge of the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the policeman was sitting where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. On the driver's side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was sitting behind the wheel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he alone in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, I didn't think nothing about it; you know, the police
are nice and friendly, and I thought friendly conversation. Well, I looked, and
there were cars coming, so I had to wait. Well, in a few minutes this man
<span class="locked">made&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see the policeman do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. See the policeman? Well, this man, like I told you, put his
arms up, leaned over, he&mdash;just a minute, and he drew back and he stepped back
about two steps. Mr. <span class="locked">Tippit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The policeman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. The policeman calmly opened the car door, very slowly,
wasn't angry or nothing, he calmly crawled out of this car, and I still just
thought a friendly conversation, maybe disturbance in the house, I did not
know; well, just as the policeman got <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way did he walk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Towards the front of the car. And just as he had gotten
even with the wheel on the driver's <span class="locked">side&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the left front wheel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; this man shot the policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard the shots, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see the policeman do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He fell to the ground, and his cap went a little ways out on
the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did the man do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. The man, he just walked calmly, fooling with his gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Toward what direction did he walk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Come back towards me, turned around, and went back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Toward Patton?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; towards Patton. He didn't run. It just didn't
scare him to death. He didn't run. When he saw me he looked at me, stared at
me. I put my hands over my face like this, closed my eyes. I gradually opened
my fingers like this, and I opened my eyes, and when I did he started off in
kind of a little trot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Towards Jefferson, right across that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he have the pistol in his hand at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had the gun when I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you yell at him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. When I pulled my fingers down where I could see, I got my
hand down, he began to trot off, and then I ran to the policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you put your hands over your eyes, before you put your
hand over your eyes, did you see the man walk towards the corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, he stared at me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I didn't do anything. I couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Didn't you say something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, I couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or yell or scream?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I could not. I could not say nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You looked at him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You looked at him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir. He looked wild. I mean, well, he did to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you say you saw him fooling with his gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had it in his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see what he was doing with it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He was just fooling with it. I didn't know what he was
doing. I was afraid he was fixing to kill me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far away from the police car do you think you were on the
corner when you saw the shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, I wasn't too far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you estimate it in feet? Don't guess.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I would just be afraid to say how many feet because I am
a bad judgment on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you looked at the man, though, when he came toward the
corner, you were standing on one corner, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was he standing with reference to the other corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. After he had <span class="locked">shot&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he looked at you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. After he had shot the policeman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He was standing almost even to that curb, not very far
from the curb, from the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Across the street from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he look at you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you look at him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was before you put your hands over your eyes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; and he kept fooling with his gun, and I slapped
my hands up to my face like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you ran to the policeman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. After he ran off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In what hand did he have his gun, do you know, when he fired
the shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Sir, I believe it was his right. I am not positive because
I was scared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he came down the street towards you, in what hand did he
have his gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had it in both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had it in both of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he went towards Jefferson you say he went at sort of
a trot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he cross Patton?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were there many other, or other people in the block at that
time, or were you there with Officer Tippit almost alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was out there, I didn't see anybody. I was there alone
by myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see. You didn't see anybody else in the immediate neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; not until everything was over&mdash;I never seen anybody
until I was at Mr. Tippit's side. I tried to save his life, which was I didn't
know at that time I couldn't do something for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Tippit, Officer Tippit, didn't say anything to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He tried to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He tried to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But he didn't succeed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, I couldn't understand. I was screaming and hollering
and I was trying to help him all I could, and I would have. I was with
him until they put him in the ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make an estimate of how far you were from this man
with the gun when he came&mdash;after the shooting, and when he came down
to the corner, did you make an estimate of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No. To <span class="locked">anyone&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We measured it the other day. We were out there, weren't we?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Now I couldn't tell you how many feet or nothing because
I have never had no occasions to measure that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was it further than this table, the length of this table?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It was across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Across the street. It was two or three times the length of this
table?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Across from the street. That was too close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have a map coming from the FBI. We thought it would be
here this morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham, you were taken to the Police Department, weren't you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Immediately.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Later that day they had a showup you went to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. A lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A lineup.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many men were in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I believe there were, now I am not positive, I believe there
were three besides this man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be four people altogether?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I believe that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they of anywhere near similar build or size or coloring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, they were all about the same height.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who were you in the lineup room with?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Who was I in the room where they had this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Policemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. More than one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. The room was full.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was. In this lineup room, the room was full of policemen.
Weren't there just one or two men with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. One or two with me, but I don't know who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But there were other officers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. There were all policemen sitting in the back of me, and
aside of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In this room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir. They were doing something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you went into this room were you shown a picture of
anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did a police officer say anything to you before you went in there,
to tell <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That he thought "We had the right man," or something of
that sort? Anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No statement like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody tell you that the man you were looking for would
be in a certain position in the lineup, or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now when you went into the room you looked these people over,
these four men?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you recognize anyone in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did not? Did you see anybody&mdash;I have asked you that question
before&mdash;did you recognize anybody from their face?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. From their face, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you identify anybody in these four people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I didn't know nobody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I know you didn't know anybody, but did anybody in that lineup
look like anybody you had seen before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No. I had never seen none of them, none of these men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No one of the four?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No one of all four?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a number two man in there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Number two is the one I picked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, I thought you just told me that you <span class="locked">hadn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I thought you wanted me to describe their clothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No. I wanted to know if that day when you were in there if you
saw anyone in <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Number two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you say when you saw number two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Well, let me tell you. I said the second man, and they kept
asking me which one, which one. I said, number two. When I said number
two, I just got weak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about number two, what did you mean when you said number
two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Number two was the man I saw shoot the policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You recognized him from his appearance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I asked&mdash;I looked at him. When I saw this man I wasn't
sure, but I had cold chills just run all over me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. When I saw the man. But I wasn't sure, so, you see, I
told them I wanted to be sure, and looked at his face is what I was looking at,
mostly is what I looked at, on account of his eyes, the way he looked at me.
So I asked them if they would turn him sideways. They did, and then they
turned him back around, and I said the second, and they said, which one, and
I said number two. So when I said that, well, I just kind of fell over. Everybody
in there, you know, was beginning to talk, and I don't know, <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you recognize him from his clothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had on a light short jacket, dark trousers. I looked
at his clothing, but I looked at his face, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have the same clothing on that the man had that you saw
shoot the officer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had these dark trousers on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have a jacket or a shirt? The man that you saw shoot
Officer Tippit and run away, did you notice if he had a jacket on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had a jacket on when he done it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of a jacket, what general color of jacket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It was a short jacket open in the front, kind of a grayish
tan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell the police that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did any man in the lineup have a jacket on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I can't remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did this number two man that you mentioned to the police have
any jacket on when he was in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he have on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had on a light shirt and dark trousers.</p>

<p>(Representative Ford is now in the Commission hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you recognize the man from his clothing or from his face?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Mostly from his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you sure it was the same man you had seen before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I am sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what time of day was it that you saw this man in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I would say it was four, a little after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was four in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was so upset I couldn't even tell you the time. In fact,
I wasn't interested in the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask just one question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You referred to his eyes; they were rather striking. Can you
give any impression of how his eyes looked to you? I realize that is a very
vague question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes. He looked wild. They were glassy looking, because
I could <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He had no glasses on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No. When we looked at each other, he just stared, just
like that. I just don't know. I just seen him&mdash;I would know the man anywhere,
I know I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have here an exhibit, Commission Exhibit 162, a jacket. Did
you ever see this before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does it look like, anything like, the jacket the man had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It is short, open down the front. But that jacket it is a
darker jacket than that, I know it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't think it was as light a jacket as that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, it was darker than that, I know it was. At that moment
I was so <span class="locked">excited&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a shirt here, which is Exhibit 150. Did you ever see a
shirt the color of this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. The shirt that this man had, it was a lighter looking shirt
than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The man who shot Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; I think it was lighter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. I have some pictures here that I would like to show
you. I have Exhibits 521 and 522, which have been marked as Exhibits. Here
is one picture, 521. Do you recognize that as the sign down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. This is the corner of Patton and 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Patton and 10th.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. This is on the corner of Patton and 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes. Was the man anywhere near that corner when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After the shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Now, take this pen and put an X as to the point when
he looked at you and you looked at him.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He was right along here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put an X.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I don't know. I am too nervous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the time the man was standing at X in this picture, at this
location, which is shown in 521, where were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was on the opposite corner, across over here, like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you as close to the curb as&mdash;were you close to the curb at
that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where was the car, where this car is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No, I have another picture I will show her. I have here Exhibit
522; do you recognize the white house in the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the driveway next to it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that show the location of the police car at the time it stopped?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir. That is the big old white house, 404.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. 10th Street, and this driveway and this house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Will you give us an idea, Mr. Ball, as to where she said she was
on this picture? Was she over here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have a picture. There is a booklet here that has been prepared
by a succession of witnesses. We have a general diagram here which I
will show the witness at this time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham, there is a diagram here which shows 10th Street going
in an easterly and westerly direction, Patton running north and south.</p>

<p>(Marked Commission Exhibit No. 523 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you understand that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. This would be the corner I would be at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No, this would be Patton. This is north and south. Jefferson is
down here. Can you locate yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. This is 10th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is 10th.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. And this Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was standing on the corner of 10th and Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right. But which corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Northeast corner is where I was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Northeast or northwest? This would be northeast and this would
be northwest. Here is where the squad car would be. Right there. Here is 404.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It would be this corner then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, that is northeast and that is northwest. Were you kitty-cornered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was kitty-cornered from it like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, this is northwest, this is northeast, southeast, southwest, and
here is the car. We are going down the street now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It would be this&mdash;that would be on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right. Look at a number on that and tell me where you
were standing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was standing right at the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you see a number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Number 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Number 5 on this diagram would be indicating the place where
you would be standing, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was standing on the opposite corner from that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I know, but I have got to get you to tell me where you were
standing. Picture yourself going down Patton towards Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Going down Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were coming from this direction. Your home was up here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was coming down Patton. It would be this corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That corner, all right. Take this pen and show your course down
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Just draw it right on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Down to where you stood.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Right on the edge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there a number there that shows where you were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Near 5, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is the northwest corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Northwest corner; that is the northwest corner. Here is a picture.
Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is picture number 3 in the booklet. Does that show where
you were?</p>

<p>(Marked Commission Exhibit No. 524 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the man shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a mark where you first saw him. Mark that A. Then he
went which direction down the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He went this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, he went in a direction&mdash;draw a line and then put
an arrow showing what direction.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. From <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Right on down the side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Make a mark and put an arrow. That was the direction he was
walking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The police car had not come into sight yet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put an X where the police car was when you first saw it, put an X
there and we will mark that B. Now, after the shooting, where was the man
when you looked at him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He turned and came back this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did he stand and look at you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a mark there. We will mark that C. Where were you standing
when he was looking at you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. The same position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same position as the girl shown on this picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that your picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is you there in that picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stand there for the photographer to show him where you
were standing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to offer into evidence the diagram in this book, together
with the picture which illustrates the diagram.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Under what numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As 523, which is the diagram, and 524, which is the picture.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents identified as Commission Exhibits Nos. 521&ndash;524 were
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went out there in picture number 3. Now, Mr. Dulles, I think
this will explain it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes, Mr. Ball.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have some other pictures here that might illustrate. Do you
recognize this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were here the time the picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told the parties where to put the squad car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does this show the place where the police car was when this
happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The place at the arrow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It shows a corner.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the picture make a mark where the man was when he came
back and looked at you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir. He was a little behind this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just make an X there in general.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That is supposed to be on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to have this marked as Commission Exhibit 525. The
X marks the position of the man who did the shooting on the corner after the
shooting, and the arrow points to the squad car. Here is another picture
marked 4 in this book which I will mark as Commission Exhibit 526. Is that
you in the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went out there the day the picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that where you were when you saw the shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you move from that place from the time of the shooting until
the time you saw the man on the corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder, Mrs. Markham, if you would repeat for me, I would
like to hear it, and Congressman Ford would like to hear it, the scene that
you saw where the man now known to be Oswald went up and put his arms on
the door of the police car, as I understand it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you tell that once again. I would like to hear it again.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He calmly walked to the car. He wasn't in no hurry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask, was he called, were there any words that you heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, I did not. I seen the police car stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You didn't hear the policeman say, "Come here," or anything of
that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He might have done it, but you didn't hear it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. That is right. And the man went over to the car, put his
hands on the <span class="locked">window&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The window was open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Leaned over like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Let me see. Was that on the right-hand side of the car, or where
the driver was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It was on the opposite side of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Opposite side of the car from the driver, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes. The window was down, and I know it was down, I
know, and he put his arms and leaned over, I don't know what they were talking
about, I didn't hear it. Then he stepped back in a few minutes, stepped
back two steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He stepped back two steps from the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Just stepped back twice. Mr. Tippit, of course, the policeman&mdash;I
didn't know it was Mr. <span class="locked">Tippit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He calmly opened the door. He calmly crawled out like he
wasn't angry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he have a weapon in his hands?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I didn't see one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He was just calmly walking to the front of the car and
when he got even with the wheel on the driver's side, front, you know, that
man shot him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you see him draw his revolver?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He shot him like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Like this, you mean from the hip or from the waist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes. In the wink of your eye, before you could ever&mdash;just
like that. It didn't seem like it bothered him, disturbed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The policeman hadn't made, as far as you could see, any menacing
gestures toward him? He wasn't trying to grab him or anything of that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No. He was very calm, very. I would say like in slow motion,
you know, like he was getting out to talk with the man, or go in the house
for disturbance or something, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He shot across the hood of the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Across the hood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The policeman was in the street, walking in the street around to
the front of the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The policeman then got out on the opposite side of where
Oswald was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, I guess he was coming around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It appeared as though he was walking around the
front of the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had started around, and then he was going over to the
man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had only reached the left front wheel though when he was
shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he fell into the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He fell into the street, his hat fell off his head. He didn't
fall, just clumped down like that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did the man with the gun move at all as the officer
started to go around the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No. He didn't move. I mean, walked back or anything like
that, no, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He didn't appear to run?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No. I didn't know anything was going to happen. If I
had I would have kept walking, not walking, running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He had walked slowly around the car to meet the other man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. The policeman was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Slow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a pool of blood where Mr. Tippit fell in the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you this picture, Exhibit 533 (renumbered as Exhibit 527,
see p. 321). Will you look at that picture and tell me whether it shows the approximate
position where Mr. Tippit fell after he was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He fell right out this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Look at the discoloration in the street. Is that anywhere near
where Tippit fell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It don't seem to me it was out that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It doesn't?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It seemed like to me it was over this way because he fell
this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He fell this way? These people can't see what you are showing here.
Here is the pool of blood. Which way do you think he fell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. See the wheel would be right down under here, back right
this way. He fell this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Into the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, and his head was like this, you know, it was laying
like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is this splotch out here in front of the car the pool of blood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Out to the left.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It seems to me it ought to be here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But there was a pool of blood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will pass this out to the Commissioners.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask this, Mr. Ball, the place where you pointed,
where you thought the pool of blood different from where it is shown on here
was only a matter of what, a foot or two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; just about a little, back a little. It seems his
hat was this way.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So it is a difference of a foot or two, at the most?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you see the blood at this time or just see him fall? Did
you actually see blood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Did I actually see it, sir? I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I know you were there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I was standing over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were standing right over the officer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes. Just as soon as, just as quick as I could get to him; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
the blood was coming from here like this and like that, in an oval shape. It did
not splutter on his face too much, his mouth. It was here, coming out here.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The blood was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, just gushes. I had my workshoes in my hand. I laid
them up on the squad car. I had my purse, which I can't remember where I
put it, but this, I had a head scarf around my head, I had my coat on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to offer all of these into evidence at this time, up to
526, inclusive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be received.</p>

<p>(The items identified as Commission Exhibits Nos. 525 and 526 were received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Dulles, will you preside in my absence, please. I must
attend a session of the Court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I will, sir.</p>

<p>(The Chairman left the hearing room at this point.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Markham, the police car, did the police car go beyond the
man who was walking along the sidewalk, or did it stop opposite him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Almost even with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when the police car stopped, did the man stop?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir; and walked over to the policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The police car was going in the same direction as the man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And caught up with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Markham, do you know a man named Mark Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever hear of the name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to a New York lawyer who says he was from
New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to a lawyer who was investigating the case in
behalf of the deceased man, Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to a man who said he was representing the
mother of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't remember ever talking to a man named Mark Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In an appearance before this Commission, a man named Mark
Lane has testified this way. Let me read it to you. That was on Wednesday,
March 4, 1964, Vol. II of a public hearing before this Commission, page 51.
This is what he said:</p>

<p>"I spoke with the deponent"&mdash;he is talking about an affidavit that you made
to the Dallas Police Department&mdash;"I spoke with the deponent, the eyewitness,
Helen Louise Markham, and Mrs. Markham told me&mdash;Miss or Mrs., I didn't
ask her if she was married&mdash;told me she was 100 feet away from the police
car, not the 50 feet which appears in the affidavit."</p>

<p>Do you recall ever stating that to Mr. Lane or anyone else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He testified: "She gave me a more detailed description of the
man who she said shot Officer Tippit. She said he was short, a little on the
heavy side, and his hair was somewhat bushy." Did you say that to Mark
Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir; I don't even know the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or anybody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever tell anyone that the man who shot Tippit was short,
a little on the heavy side, and his hair was somewhat bushy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the man, is it your memory now that the man who shot
Tippit was short, a little on the heavy side?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir. He wasn't too heavy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it your memory that his hair was bushy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It wasn't so bushy. It was, say, windblown or something.
What I mean, he didn't have a lot of hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't have a lot of hair?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir; that I could see. I don't even know that man;
I never talked to nobody.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You didn't talk to him by telephone or any other means?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you ever get an anonymous phone call from a
person who asked you these questions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, he also says, and he testified as follows:</p>

<p>"Helen Markham said to me she was taken to the police station on that
same day, that she was very upset. She, of course, had never seen anyone
killed in front of her eyes before, and in the police station she identified Oswald
as the person who had shot Officer Tippit in the lineup, including three other
persons. She said no one pointed Oswald out to her, and she said she was
just shown four people, and she picked Oswald. She said when he asked her
how she could identify him, she said she was able to identify him because of
his clothing, a gray jacket and dark trousers."</p>

<p>Did you ever make that statement to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I did not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or to anyone else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Not to anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you identified Oswald&mdash;it was the number 2 man&mdash;were
you told the number 2 man whom you identified in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you ever told his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ever told his name later?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Nobody, nobody told me nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, the man that you identified as the number 2 man in the
lineup in the police station, you identified him as the man you had seen shoot
Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you identify him because of his clothing that he had on at
that time in the lineup.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Just like I told you. I mostly looked at his face, his eyes,
and his clothing, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He said here you were able to identify him, Mark Lane testified
that you told him you were able to identify him because of his clothing, a
gray jacket. First, did the man in the lineup have a gray jacket on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he have on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had on this light shirt, dark trousers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You have considered your answers very carefully, have you,
on this point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I am doing my best.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes, I know you are, and you are quite sure you never talked
to anyone who purported to be Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Never in my life. I talked to two men, and this man who
told me he was from Paris, France. He came down on my job. I was scared
to death. I wasn't going to talk to him. I work for a Greek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Let's get this a little more clearly, Mrs. Markham. You say
you talked with someone who came from France?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he represent a French newspaper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You don't know what newspaper?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No. He told&mdash;you see, I didn't understand this man, but
my boss could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He came to you in the restaurant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes. And I was scared, which I was scared of everybody.
I was upset and trying to work, too, and he was&mdash;he come to me and he asked
for me and, of course, they knew who I was because I was there so long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I don't recall the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was it 2 or 3 days after the assassination or was it right after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It was quite some time after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Some time after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. A week or more, maybe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you describe this man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had&mdash;he was dark complected, very nice man, black
horn-rimmed glasses, black-headed, and he was build kind <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What did he ask you&mdash;excuse me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was he tall or short, heavy set?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. About medium, I guess. I didn't pay much attention to
the man.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he have an accent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, he did.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it difficult for you to understand him because of
this accent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes. This is what this man told me. He told me&mdash;he told
my boss and my boss also told me, my boss stood right beside me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he speak in English with an accent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes. But this man told me the Government sent him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did he identify which government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He had&mdash;he showed me who he was. He was a news reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he say whether he was a foreigner or an American citizen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I can't remember. I was too scared. But he did show me
his identification, his picture and everything. The Government had sent him
to me, which he was coming to Washington. He was supposed to be here, and
then back somewhere in Dallas, I think he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you recall the questions he asked you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He just asked me very few questions. This man asked me
about if the police had taken me down to the police station and did I see anything
after I went into the police station, hear any TV, or see any TV, any
radio, newspapers, or anybody talked to me, and I said they did not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did your employer listen to the questions and answers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, James Gambolis listened to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We will take a moment's recess.</p>

<p>(A short recess was taken.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d of November, 1963, that is the day of the shooting, did
you talk to an FBI agent named Odum? Do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I talked to some people, men, down at the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right. He says that you described the man who shot Tippit
as a white male, about 18, black hair, red complexion, wearing black shoes, tan
jacket, and dark trousers. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I never said anything about his shoes because I never did
look at his feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say about 18?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I said he was young looking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you give that age, 18?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say he had black hair?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You thought he was black-haired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, that is what I told him. I thought he was black-haired.
I remember saying that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Red complexion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, not red complexioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mrs. Markham, did you say you talked to two persons, one person
whom you are now describing from a foreign newspaper, and one other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Who was the other one with whom you talked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I don't recall. He was a newspaper reporter by Life magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Life magazine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes. I remember, which they did print the picture in Life
magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And Life magazine printed what you told them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And printed it accurately as far as you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Very little of what I told him did he put in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What they put in was accurate more or less?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It coincided with what you told him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, just a little old paragraph or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Except for those two persons, you don't recall talking with
anyone about your testimony or your appearance in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just those two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just a few more questions, Mrs. Markham. You ran immediately
over to where the police officer was lying in the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he alive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He was trying to, but he just couldn't. I just couldn't make
out what he was trying to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did some man come up immediately thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of a car did he have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Not immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Soon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Soon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In a pickup truck?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes. I very frankly remembered this truck, but I remember
it the way it took off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He stopped though, didn't he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the man who called over the police radio, wasn't he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he look like, the man in the pickup truck?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. This man had a hat on. I thought he was a policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A dark man, looked somewhat Spanish?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I don't recall. I was screaming and crying and trying to
get help, begging for somebody to help me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you start screaming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I started screaming by the time I left where I was standing
and screamed plumb across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what you said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. "The man has killed a policeman," I remember, "Somebody
help. He has killed him, he has killed him," I was saying that, I was pulling
my hair almost. It is a wonder he did not turn and kill me, really it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Mr. Scoggins?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I don't <span class="locked">remember&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The taxicab driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, I saw the taxicab driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the taxicab?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Parked on Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Patton?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the man later, did you see him before the shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, he was sitting in his cab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was. Then you saw him afterward, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Those are all the questions I have of this witness. Do you have
something additional?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Believe me, it was just <span class="locked">like&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I believe Mr. Ford would like to have the witness repeat what
she saw the man, now known as Oswald, do after the shooting. Will you just
repeat that for Congressman Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. After he shot the <span class="locked">policeman&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. After he shot the policeman.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. After he shot the policeman he turned around, came back
around toward Patton Street. He wasn't he didn't seem to be in a no hurry.
I thought he hadn't done anything, and he was fooling with his gun in his hands,
and he seen me, and he stops.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He stopped?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. When he saw me. That is the reason we were looking at
each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He hadn't seen you before so far as you could tell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I put my hands over my face and closed my eyes, because
I knew he was going to kill me. I couldn't scream, I couldn't holler. I froze.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think you testified about that then he began to run slowly.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. <span class="locked">Then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was that after he saw you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes; after I put my hands up, and when I had opened my
fingers and my eyes and slowly pulled them down, he was trotting off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Trotting off?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir. He wasn't out of sight when I started running to
this police car. He was not out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You didn't see which way he turned at the end of this run?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; he cut across like this, across Patton, and went out
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Like this means to the right or to the left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. It means to the right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To his right, to the man's right, as he was running?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. He ran back, turned and came back down 10th to Patton
Street. He cut across Patton Street like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Heading toward what street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Toward Jefferson; yes, sir. Then he was still in sight when
I began to scream and holler and run to this police car, well, to Mr. Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are there any more questions?</p>

<p>You can be excused, Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you have any questions you would like to ask, Mr. Attorney

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you wait for just a moment. We are sorry to detain you.

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Exhibit previously marked "533," which is the squad car, Tippit,

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, I went most of the time in McLennan County; most
of my schooling was down in McLennan County.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you get through school before you started to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Eighth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now what did you do after school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, while I was going to school, and that time we lived on
a farm, you know, and then after that, well, that would be a hard problem
there. I left home when I was rather young, stayed with some of my brothers
some, and then done odd jobs around for quite a while. My first job, I guess
you might say, would be automobile paint job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Automobile paint job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. New York City. How long did you stay in New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Approximately 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I went back to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Done farmwork.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And about how long did you do farmwork, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well now, after&mdash;let's see, my life was kind of mixed up.
I have been around quite a while in different places and things. After I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
left New York I went to Connecticut to join the CCC camp and stayed there 3
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. CCC camp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir. And then I went back to Texas.</p>

<p>The first thing I done was open up a cafe down there and operated it about
a year, and from there went to Waco and worked in a cotton mill, and then I
moved back to west Texas to a little town about 18 miles out of Waco, and
lived there, and done farmwork for a couple or 3 years, and then I moved to
Dallas.</p>

<p>I think late in 1941, and I worked for Newhoff Packers in Dallas for 2 years,
and then I went into the aircraft business and worked for North American
approximately 3 years, and then I went into the contracting business for about
a year, and went to General Dynamics, worked there approximately 15½ years,
and then I have been working for the company, taxicab company, for a couple
of years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been driving a cab for 2 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, not quite 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A little bit less than 2 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. A year and 9 months. I don't know exactly when I started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you driving your cab in the early part of the afternoon
of November 22, 1963, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, I picked up a gentleman at Love Field at approximately
12:35, I would say, and I discharged him at 1 o'clock at 321 North Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I went around by the Gentlemen's Club which I believe is 125
Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I pulled up and parked at the corner of Patton and 10th and
went back down to the club. At first, whenever I passed by, one of the guys
hollered at me and asked me did I know the President had been shot, and I
made the remark that I had not heard that one. I found a place to park and I
came back, and he came back there in a couple of minutes and told me the facts
about it. I thought it was some kind of a joke.</p>

<p>So I had to go plumb up to the corner of 10th before I could find a parking
place, and I parked right there on the corner and went back and got me a
coke and watched the deal, watched the television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you speak a little louder, please; I can't quite hear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I got me a coke and watched television for a few minutes, I
would say 10, 12, 15 minutes, there, and went out to eat my lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What were you seeing on television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. The deal about the President getting assassinated; and when
I got back to my cab and got my lunch, and, well, I noticed a police car cruising
east there on 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was your cab parked with relationship to the intersection
of Patton and 10th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, it was headed north on Patton, facing 10th Street, on
the right-hand side of the street, right close to where the stop sign had been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, the right-hand side of the street would be the east or the
west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It would be the east side. I was headed north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Were you on the north side of the intersection or the
south side of the intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. South side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How near the intersection were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Right near. They had a stop sign there and someone had
had a wreck previously, I don't know, the sign was down. It was laying there,
it had been bent over.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was this a normal stop for you, or how did you happen
to be stopped there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, I just went around just like I say. We can take our
lunch hour anytime, you know; we can call in and say we are going to be out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
service for lunch or for anything we might want to be out for, and that is
what I had done.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This was not a regular place where you waited for
calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No. You see the way we operate there, just where we discharge
a passenger, then we call in and tell them where we are at on our
radio, and if they have anybody in that vicinity who needs a cab, they give us
their address, you see. Of course, now in the downtown area we do have
stands to operate from, at the hotels, and then we have some stands at the
medical buildings and the depot and the bus stations; and if we want to pick
up there, we can pick up and we don't need to call in. But if we want to sit
there we can call in that we are in this neighborhood. If they have got someone
who has requested a cab, they give us the address, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, showing you Commission Exhibit 528, I would like
to ask you to state, if you know, what this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir; that is the corner where I was sitting right here, you
see, on 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to something in the front-center part of the
picture. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. That is the stop sign that had been knocked over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is the knocked-over stop sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What intersection is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Tenth and Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, we offer in evidence remarked Exhibit 527 and also Exhibit
528.</p>

<p>(The items identified as Commission Exhibits Nos. 527 and 528 were received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, handing you what has been marked as Commission
Exhibit 523, which purports to be a plat, you see the streets of Patton Avenue
there and East 10th. Do you see any number on that exhibit, Exhibit 523,
which would indicate the approximate location of your car during the period
that you are describing here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, it looks to me like this number 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are not pointing to number 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Eleven, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It is 11, and here is 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It looked like a 10 to me. Number 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Number 11 is, you think, where you were with regard <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Within the general area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Within the general area of Number 11 on Exhibit 523.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Scoggins, you stated you were sitting in your cab as you stopped
at your intersection. You had a coke and your lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were you doing, eating your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I was in the process of eating it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were in the process?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I had taken one or two bites of my sandwich and drank a
couple of swallows out of my coke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What time was this, approximately, as far as you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Around 1:20 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Will you please state then what happened, what you
saw, what you did, what you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, I first seen the police car cruising east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how fast was it cruising?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Not more than 10 or 12 miles a hour, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was going east on what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. On Tenth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Did you see the police car go across right in front of
yours?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; he went right down the street. He come from the west,
going east on east Tenth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I noticed he stopped down there, and I wasn't paying too much
attention to the man, you see, just used to see him every day, but then I kind
of looked down the street, saw this, someone, that looked to me like he was
going west, now, I couldn't exactly say whether he was going west or was in
the process of turning around, but he was facing west when I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. And he was&mdash;he stopped there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this now. When you first saw this man, had the
police car stopped or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; he stopped. When I saw he stopped, then I looked to see
why he was stopping, you see, and I saw this man with a light-colored jacket on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you saw a man with a light-colored jacket. With relation to
the police car, was the man east of the police car, west of the police car, or
kind <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Just a little east is the best I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was a little bit east of the police car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; he was just a little bit forward. The police car headed
east and he was a little bit, maybe not more than the front end of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You thought the man was at the front end of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But by that you mean the front wheel or front bumper area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he on the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. At the time I saw him; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you first saw him, I believe you said you saw the man's face,
or did you not say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I couldn't see the man's face from there. I saw the face when
he passed the cab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What led you to believe that he was walking west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, he was facing west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean he was facing west when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; he was kind of facing that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it due west the way the sidewalk was, or was <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; west in relation to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Then what did you see the man do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I saw him turn facing the street, and then I didn't see him any
more after that because he went behind some shrubbery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the police officer do anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I saw him get out of the police car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see what side he went out of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He got out of the driver's side, left-hand side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Then he took about a step, I would say, or approximately one
or two steps, and then I wasn't really&mdash;you know&mdash;I went back to my eating,
and about that time I heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Three or four, in the neighborhood. They was fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They were fast shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; they were fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do or say or hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Then I saw the man falling, grab his stomach and fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which man did you see fall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. The policeman. I was excited when I heard them shots, and I
started to get out&mdash;since we went back over there the other day and reenacted
that scene, I must have seen him fall as I was getting out of my cab, because
I got out of the cab, and in the process of getting out of the cab I seen this guy
coming around, so I got out of sight. I started to cross the street, but I seen
I didn't have enough time to cross the street before he got down there, so I got
back behind the cab, and as he cut across that yard I heard him running into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
some bushes, and I looked up and seen him going south on Patton and then when
I jumped back in my cab I called my dispatcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you jump out of your cab first when you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Because anytime that there is anything going on that is one
thing the cab driver wants to do is to get away from that cab, because the man
is going to try&mdash;if he had ever seen the cab, he looked back over his left shoulder,
and I don't think he even seen the cab&mdash;he would have probably jumped in the
cab and had me take him somewhere or maybe shot me, too, you know, and I
didn't want to be around the cab at anytime while he was in the neighborhood,
you know, when there was anything like that going on, or anything, robbery,
or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe you said you saw the officer fall. Did you see where he
fell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; he fell right by the side of the front, about, a little bit
forward of the door, right about the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever later go up and view the officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. I went up there, but by the time I got up there the
ambulance had already got there. You see I got my dispatcher and was telling
him about it, just by that time the ambulance got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice anything in the street to indicate where the officer
fell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. There was blood there, of course. They picked the man up by
the time I got there, the ambulance did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question? You were in touch with your dispatcher
over your radio contact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What did you tell your dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I told him there had been a policeman shot at 10th and Patton,
and you see they have a number of cars they are talking to, you know, and
I had to holler about three or four times before I got his attention, and then I
seen I wasn't going to get through to him, so I just hollered there had been a
policeman shot at 10th and Patton, and then they went to talking to me then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What did they say to you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. The first thing they says is do they need an ambulance, and
I says, "Sure." And they wanted to know the exact location, and I said right
off east of 10th and Patton, and the ambulance was only a block and a quarter
or so from the scene, you see, and they just come on right around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And this conversation took you a minute or two, would you
estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, a couple of minutes, I would say. It was pretty close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, handing you what the Commission reporter has
marked, or what has been marked as Commission Exhibit 527, I ask you to
state if this substance on the street here appears to be anything you had ever
seen before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; that appears to be the officer's blood, blood from the
officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that located in approximate location to this car in the same
relative position that you saw the blood when you were there, or is it any
different, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I was kind of excited there, a little bit, and I could be mistaken,
but I was thinking he was a little bit closer to the car than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You thought he was a little bit closer to the car than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. I thought he was, but I could be mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you what has been marked Commission Exhibit 529,
which shows a picture of a car and appears to be some kind of a stain in the
street, does that look to you any closer to the car than Exhibit 527, or does that
look to be about the same place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It looks to be about the same place as that one there does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You thought it was a little bit closer to the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. All right. I thought it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the officer fall, did he fall forward or backward in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He fell forward.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He fell forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where his head was lying as he fell forward, if
you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I wouldn't be sure about that. He kind of fell in a crumpled
manner, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you saw the officer fall, when was the next place that you
saw the man, or did you see him at the same time you saw the officer fall, the
other man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No. I saw him coming kind of toward me around that cutoff
through there, and he never did look at me. He looked back over his left
shoulder like that, as he went by. It seemed like I could see his face, his features
and everything plain, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he walking or running or trotting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Kind of loping, trotting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Kind of loping or trotting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Not in too big a hurry. It didn't seem like at first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At first not too big a hurry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he change that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Never did change his pace as long as I saw him. I don't know
where he went after he passed the cab and got down a little piece, because then
I was busy trying to get my dispatcher, and I never did look and never did
get to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he have anything in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He had a pistol in his left hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the pistol appear to be&mdash;did he appear to be doing anything
with the pistol or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. He had it, holding it, in his left hand in a manner that
the barrel was up like this, and the stock was down here, curved back in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it look like the gun had been flipped open at all or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I wouldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You said he had it in his left hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see where his right hand was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He was kind of running, kind of like this, in this manner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear the man say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I heard him mutter something like, "poor damn cop," or "poor
dumb cop." He said that over twice, and the last, I don't know whether the
middle word was "damn" or "dumb," but anyway, he muttered that twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear him say any other word or phrase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear anyone else making any noise at about that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No; I didn't. Of course, there were people coming up there,
around there, but I didn't&mdash;I didn't notice any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Recently in Dallas you were asked to go to the scene of the Tippit
shooting to try to reconstruct the positions of the various people at this time; is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, yes; I was over <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you parked your cab in what spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. There on Patton, facing 10th at approximately the place I
thought I was parked at, the reasonable area where I thought I was. I wouldn't
say I was exactly on that spot, but within a foot or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does Exhibit 530 appear to be a picture of your cab at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I also hand you Commission Exhibit 531 and ask you if there is
another view of your cab also at that same point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; it appears to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were there when those two pictures were taken?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir; I was there whenever they took some picture. I
couldn't swear these were the ones, but I imagine it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. These are pictures numbered 7 and 22 in that sequence there. Mr.
Scoggins, at the time of November 22, 1963, were there as many cars parked along
Patton Street as appear to be in these Exhibits 530 and 531?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. There wasn't as many on this side here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are speaking now when you say "This side here," you are
pointing to the east or west side of the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. On the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There weren't as many on the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. There wasn't as many here as where the pickup truck is setting
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be down below the second or third car south of East
10th, is that right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; on this other side it was taken up solid, and the only place
I could found is here is the reason I come up here and parked, because the club
is down here at this other end, and I would have taken the first parking place I
found because, you know, the closest to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As far as you know, there were no people in these cars that were
parked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No; there was no one in those cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any people in any cars parked on either side of Patton
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, handing you Exhibit 162, have you ever seen any
jacket on any person in that area of East 10th and Patton that looks familiar
to, or looks anything similar to this exhibit, or does this appear to be lighter or
darker than the jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It appears to be a little lighter, but the sleeves look familiar
all right, the type of sleeve. He had on a jacket, the type of sleeve of that, but
I thought it was a little darker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether it was a zipper or button jacket or don't
<span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No; I couldn't tell you that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what kind of trousers the man was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. The best I can remember they was dark, not too dark, and he
had on a light shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A light shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I wouldn't say it was white, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would the shirt be lighter than Exhibit 150 or about the same color
or darker or would Exhibit 150 look anything like the shirt you thought he was
wearing, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, I don't, so I couldn't answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you say you don't know, or you think this is different than
what he was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I couldn't say about the shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I just couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, when you were in Dallas the other day and they took
these pictures, they also tried to take a picture through your car windows toward
the place where the car of Officer Tippit was parked, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where the car of Officer Tippit was parked on
November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, it was parked approximately between the first and
second houses and across the driveway between the houses, pretty well across
the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it parked across a driveway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir. As well as I remember, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you what has been marked Exhibit 522, which purports
to be a picture taken of a squad car, and I don't know if you can see through
the window a little <span class="locked">driveway&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does that appear to be the driveway in front of which the squad
car was parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does that appear to be the two houses between which the driveway
ran?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. This would be the two houses&mdash;and the other one I
didn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We have a magnifying glass here, and I believe with it we might
be able to see the number on that house. Can you see the number over the doorway
of that house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. 404.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be which street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. That would be on East 10th, on the south side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This appears to be, or does not appear to be, the position of the
car on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; that appears to be the approximate position; I would
say it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, handing you what has been marked Exhibit 532, do you
remember when this picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I remember the day. I don't remember the date of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But you remember it was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I remember it was taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sometime in March of this year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw the photographer point the camera through the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is this about the view that you had toward the police car on
November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you were eating your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And it appears that you can see through one of the windows there
the police car, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the police car at the time Exhibit 532 was taken, was it
in the approximate same position that the car of Officer Tippit was on November
22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I would think so, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you saw the police car there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it parked about in front of that driveway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; I would say in the same area. You know, it may not be
on the same inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Within a foot or two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if you would take Exhibit 523 and see if there is any
number on Exhibit 523 which corresponds to the position of the man who was
walking along East 10th Street, or wherever he was when you first saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Approximately where 16 is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes; you are pointing to the position where the arrow is in number
16?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Belin, he didn't see him walking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I saw him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I used the word "walking." Pardon me. When you first saw
him he was on point 16. Where did you see him when you next saw him, where
did you see him when he moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. When I next saw him he was in the process of running up
10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You next saw him after the shooting then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About where was he on 10th Street when you next saw him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He was on the sidewalk when I saw him, about, I would say,
about&mdash;I am trying to figure out now&mdash;about number 21 or back a little piece
from 21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Here is the squad car and 21 would be just east of the squad car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You saw him there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was he doing when you saw him in the area of 21 in
Exhibit 523?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He was proceeding west on 10th and <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. I wonder if you would just take this pen and on
Exhibit 523 mark the route that you think this man took.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. This is a sidewalk here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. This is the house back here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is the corner house, this is the second house, this is the
third house, 400, 404, and 410.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What does that line show, Mr. Belin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is to show the movement of the man from point 21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Along the sidewalk going west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He ran to the point in the shrubbery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that as far as you have seen him go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have now marked by ink line commencing on Exhibit 523
to a point that I will mark is the route that you believe you saw the man take.
Where were you when you saw him take this route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. When I first saw him coming, you see, over here, I got out of
my cab and I started to cross the street to find a place to get behind, and I got
midway across the street, and then I got back and hid behind the cab. I didn't
see him in here, but I saw him when he hit the shrubbery, when he hit that
shrubbery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There is an opening in part of that shrubbery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, and I heard that when he hit that, and he was looking
over his left shoulder at that time. I first saw him and then I got <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if you would show us on Exhibit 531, if you would put
an X there, the approximate location you were when you saw this man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. When I first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No; when you first&mdash;yes, you can put where you first saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I was sitting inside my cab when I first saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I mean after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. After the shooting I guess when I first saw him, right along
about here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, we are going to put&mdash;you had gotten out of your car,
and we are going to put a letter "A" with an arrow there. Where were you
when you saw him coming through the bushes, or by the bushes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I was back there beside my cab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were still at that same point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, when I first saw him I left the cab and I went out to the
middle of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when you first saw him and he was at the point
you marked, position 21 here on Exhibit 523?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At point "A." Then you went to the&mdash;you went out to the street,
in the street, and came back to point "A" on Exhibit 531&mdash;were you standing
or were you crouched?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I was kind of crouched down behind the cab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. How did you see him if you were crouched?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, whenever he run through those bushes I looked up
again, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You looked through your cab window?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I heard him&mdash;whenever I heard him hit those <span class="locked">bushes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you stand or just look through your cab window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I just looked and saw he was going down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how close was this man to you when you saw him, the
closest when you saw him coming through the bushes, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Oh, I would say from here to that chair down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. About that chair down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 12 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Referring to your tracing of the path that the man later found
to be Oswald followed, he went through the lower of these two bushes there,
did he? He went right through it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir. You see there is an opening in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But he didn't apparently take the opening, according to this,
because he went right through the bushes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, because I didn't see any opening in there. Was there
an opening in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Dulles, for the record, when you are referring to 523, there
is an opening between the shrubbery, but within the shrubbery itself there is an
opening, and I think it will appear if <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think the witness testified he heard the bushes move.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes. But the opening within the bushes, is it a large opening
or a small opening between the bushes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It is not too large, but a man can get through very easily by
going through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But he hits the bushes as he goes through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see. That makes it clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It is not the wide opening between the two sets of bushes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It is not quite as wide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It is an opening between the bushes themselves, like maybe
someone had planted three bushes and maybe one of them had died to break the
shrubbery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That has happened to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What I am saying, Mr. Dulles, on Exhibit 523 there are two groups
of bushes. Within the lower group of bushes there is a slight space to which the
witness is referring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see. It is not the space here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It is not the space between the two sets of bushes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At this point do you recall whether he was running or walking
or what pace was he going at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He was going at a kind of lope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Lope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, what you might call a little trot. He did not seem in
too big a hurry, but he wasn't walking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, you last saw the man when he was at the point that
you let the line stop at on Exhibit 523, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir. That would be in the approximate location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I got on my radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you told us about calling your dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, I got back in my cab to call my dispatcher, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. And then I got out of the cab and run down there; the ambulance
had already arrived by the time I got there, and they were in the process
of picking the man up, and they had done had him, was putting him on the
stretcher when I got there, and they put him in the ambulance and took him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
away, and there was someone that got on the radio at that time and they told
him he was going to report it, so they told him to get off the air, that it had already
been reported, and he picks up the officer's pistol that was laying on the ground,
apparently fell out of his holster when he fell, and says, "Come on, let's go see
if we can find him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Before you ask the next question, I wonder if I can ask one
question here. Do you know whether the ambulance came as a result of the
message you sent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You do not know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. From the time angle, do you think that could have happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It was awful fast if it did. They got there awfully quickly if
they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You don't know of any other warning going in; you put your
warning in, and that is all you know about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. That is all I know about it at that time, and I do know this other
gentleman called after I got up to the car, he called in, and they told him it had
already been.</p>

<p>(Off the record discussion.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, I started to ask you about the revolver of the policeman
when you came and saw him. This was in his holster or on the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It was on the street whenever I saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know where it was with relation to the policeman's body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It was there pretty close to his body, you know, like kind of
under his body when they picked him up. It either fell out of his holster or was
laying on the ground, one, I don't know which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see him do? This man came up and picked up the
policeman's gun. He picked it up and said, "Let's go see if we can find him?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I thought the man was a kind of police, Secret Service or
something, I didn't know, and I take him and we drove around over the
neighborhood looking, and I still didn't know what kind&mdash;I still thought he was
connected with the police department in some way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What route did you take as you drove over the neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I couldn't tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You can't tell us the route you took over the neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I was doing the driving and he was doing the directing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He directed you where to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Actually, I couldn't say where he was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Were you in your cab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you saw the pistol it wasn't in Officer Tippit's
hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, sir; oh, he never did have a pistol in his hand, as far as
I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw him when he was falling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; he was holding his stomach.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw him holding his stomach as he fell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he have anything in his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. If he did I couldn't see it, and I don't think he ever got to his
pistol from what I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the man with the gun as he opened his gun, as he
was going to the west on&mdash;up 10th Street at all after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you went around to look for the man, did you find him
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No. We drove around and asked several people, but we did
not see anybody that looked like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, by that time there was more policemen there than you
can shake a stick at. They were all over that place, and we stopped the cab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At about what time, do you know offhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. About 1:30, I guess, approximately 1:30; between 1:30 and
1:35, I would say. We cruised around several blocks looking for him, and we&mdash;one
of these police cars came by and this fellow who was with me stopped it,
and we got back in the car and went back up to the scene, and he give them the
pistol, and that time is when I found out he wasn't an officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened, or what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, they was questioning a lot of people and questioning
everybody, and they was talking, and so I went back and got on my radio and
contacted my supervisor, and they wanted me to come into the office and make
a statement, and so I did, the cab company. One of the supervisors got a
statement of it, and he asked me did the police, did I give them a statement,
and I told him no because, and he said, "Well, why didn't you?" I said, "They
didn't ask me. They talked with everybody else."</p>

<p>So the next day they took me down and put me through a lineup, showed
me a lineup of four people, and I identified the one that I had seen the day
before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, let me ask you this question. First of all, do you remember,
or can you describe the man you saw on November 22 with the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He was a medium-height fellow with, kind of a slender look,
and approximately, I said 25, 26 years old, somewhere along there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember the color of his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. It was light; let's see, was it light or not&mdash;medium
brown, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Medium brown, I would say&mdash;now, wait a minute. Now,
medium brown or dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Medium brown or dark hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he a Negro or a white man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. White, light complected, not real brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he fat, average build or thin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, he was slender; not real slender, but you <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he wearing glasses or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you remember about him, the color of his shoes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, I can't say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember any jewelry he might have had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say you went down to the police station when, Mr. Scoggins,
approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. You mean the time of day it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it the same day of the shooting or the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, it was the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Morning, afternoon, or evening, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, the best I can remember, they called me down from the
cab stand, the police came down to the office and picked me up. Well, the other
guy&mdash;I was close to the downtown area, and it didn't take me long to get
there, and I waited quite a while before the other man, he was quite out a ways,
and it was before dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was before dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, whenever they called me in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it have been on the afternoon of November 23, to the best
of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. When they took me down there it was along about dinner
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What do you mean by dinner time? In various parts
of the country dinner and supper get confused a little bit. Was it the noon
meal or the evening meal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes what? It was the noon meal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They took you down about the time of the noon meal, is that
correct; they took you to the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I would think that would be about the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sometime after you got there after the noon meal you saw
the lineup, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many people were in the lineup, if you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Four? Did any one of the people look anything like&mdash;strike
that. Did you identify anyone in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I identified the one we are talking about, Oswald. I identified
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't know his name as Oswald at that time, did you, or
did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, the next day I did. But, of course I didn't know what
his name was the day that I picked him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw a man in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone tell you any particular man was Oswald in the
lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, describe what happened in the police station with regard
to the lineup, what they did to you, what they said to you, and what you said
to them, and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, they had the four men up there in the lineup, and before
they brought them in they told us what they wanted us to do, to look them
over and be sure we was, in our estimation, we was right on the man, and
which one it was, the one that we saw, the one that I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they tell you one of the men was the man you saw or not,
or did they tell you "See if you can"&mdash;just what did they say? Did they say
"Here is a lineup, see if you can identify anyone," or did they say, "One of
the men in the <span class="locked">lineup"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, I believe those are the words they used. I am <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did all of these men look different to you? Were most of them
fat, or were most of them thin, or some fat, some thin, some tall, some short?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. There were two of them&mdash;the one that I identified as the one
I saw over at Oak Cliff, and there was one I saw similar to him, and the other
two was a little bit shorter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Had you been looking at television or seeing television prior to
your appearance here at the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You had not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Had you been working this Saturday morning with
your cab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, you went to work Saturday morning
at the regular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And were working when they asked you to come down
to the cab stand to go over to the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you seen any pictures of Lee Harvey Oswald in the newspapers
prior to the time you went to the police station lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I think I saw one in the morning paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you subscribe to the morning or evening paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I take the evening paper myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went down and bought a morning paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No; I didn't go out. I was looking at one of the&mdash;some of
the cab drivers had it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any television picture on the morning of November 23
of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I have never until this day seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I never have.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you have a television in your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes sir; I do. But I don't&mdash;when I get home I will read the
paper, and after you work about 12 hours you don't feel like fooling around with
television too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What number man in the lineup did you identify as having seen
on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Number 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have the man turn around, or could <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, they turned him around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they turn just one man around or all of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No; they had them all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember if the number 3 man in the lineup was wearing
the same clothes that the man you saw at the Tippit shooting wore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He had on a different shirt, and he didn't have a jacket on.
He had on kind of a polo shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before you went to view the lineup, did any of the police officers
show you a picture of this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sometime later, after the lineup, did any investigator come up to
you with a picture of anyone and ask you if you could identify him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember if he was an FBI man or a Dallas policeman
or a Secret Service agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He was an FBI or a Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he ask you and what did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He gave me some pictures, showed me several pictures there,
which was, some of them were, pretty well resembled him, and some of them
didn't, and they looked like they was kind of old pictures, and I think I picked
the wrong picture. I am not <span class="locked">too&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say to you and what did you say to him, if you
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I don't really&mdash;I know he showed me his credentials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say to you something like "These are pictures we have of
Lee Harvey Oswald"? Did he use that name in front of you, or did he say,
"Here are some pictures. See if you can identify them"&mdash;if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I don't remember, but after I got through looking at them
and everything, and I says, I told them one of these two pictures is him, out
of this group he showed me, and the one that was actually him looked like an
older man than he was to me. Of course, I am not too much on identifying
pictures. It wasn't a full shot of him, you know, and then he told me the other
one was Oswald.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Had you narrowed the number of pictures from more
than two to two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, they showed you pictures of how many
people altogether, how many different people, your best estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I would say 4 or 5.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you narrowed the number of 4 or 5 down to 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Down to two; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, at the time of the shooting, did you see any
pedestrians standing at the corner of East 10th and Patton, any of the
corners there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I didn't see anybody. I was kind of excited.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any other person walking along the street there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Not at the time of the shooting, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything you can think of that you haven't told us here
that might be relevant to what you saw in connection with the Tippit shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, I can't&mdash;nothing that I know of. That is the first time
I ever seen anything like that happen, and I was pretty well excited and
mixed up, and not knowing what to do or what not to do. But actually, of
course, right after the shooting, I saw a number of people come running over,
you see, from everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they all men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, they were just people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. General Carr, do you have any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. No, sir. I was exploring with him, but I guess we won't get into
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Those are all the questions I have. Just a second. When you
saw a picture in the morning paper of Lee Harvey Oswald, did this look similar
to the man you saw at the Tippit shooting, or did it look different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I would say similar; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it look like the same man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What kind of eyesight do you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I had my eyes examined when I went to work for the cab
company and the lady said I had remarkable eyesight. You know, they
have&mdash;after I went to work, after a while, I had to go get my eyes examined.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You had your eyes examined subsequent to your employment
with the cab company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, it was sometime after, maybe 6 months after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How many years ago was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Oh, about a year, approximately.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. At that time what did the eye examiner tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. She said I had excellent eyesight and vision.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You don't wear glasses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What about your hearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I can hear. I got good hearing. I never did have it examined
or anything, but I can hear everything.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you ever had any difficulty with the law, have
you ever had any trouble with officers of the law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I got a ticket for parking that I had to pay.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is a traffic violation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. No; I really haven't had any problems that amount to
anything otherwise than traffic violations.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Nothing other than traffic violations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, I was picked up one time in New York City for stowing
away on a tugboat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Stowing away on a boat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Actually what <span class="locked">happened&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How old were you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. 17 or 18. I was sleeping in a boxcar and they put that boxcar
on a tugboat and sent it across the river.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You stowed away without knowing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I don't think that is a very grave offense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No. I never have been in any grave trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. One more question, Mr. Scoggins. You rode up here to Washington
on an airplane with Mrs. Markham, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before you saw Mrs. Markham the other day, did you ever
recognize her as having seen her from the time of the Tippit shooting at all
or not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, I saw her down there talking to the policemen after
I came back. You see. I saw her talking to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You never actually saw her standing on the street, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I never actually observed her there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When you say, "I came back" is that when you got into your
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. After I had got in the car and toured the neighborhood and
then the policemen came along and I left my cab setting down there and
got in a car with them and left the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At what stage did you see Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. After I had gotten back up there. After I had drove around
in the neighborhood looking for Oswald or looking for this guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It was after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It was after that.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, when you identified the man in the lineup at
the police station on November 23, was there any other person who at the
same time was asked to identify a man in that lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, one other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know&mdash;one other person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what that man's name is or what his occupation is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, he drives a taxicab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; his name is Bill Whaley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I think it is Whaley. I didn't know him from Adam until that
day, you know, and he said his name was Whaley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you were there and identified a man, had Whaley already
identified that man or not? I mean, did you hear Whaley or see Whaley identify
that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No. He was sitting over on my left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was on your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. It was dark. They turned the lights out where we were
sitting. We could see the man with lights up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see Mr. Whaley at the time he made the identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, I suppose if I would have looked over there I could
have seen that there was a man there, that I could have recognized him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you looking at Mr. Whaley at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you make your identification by your voice or by your hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. By my hands, using&mdash;I put up three fingers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they tell you ahead of time to hold up the number of fingers
for the man that you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many fingers did you hold up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At the time you held up your three fingers, did you know how
many fingers Mr. Whaley was holding up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then did you know whether or not Mr. Whaley had identified the
man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any person or were there any persons standing between
you and Mr. Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. That I don't know because I did not look over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could Mr. Whaley, in your opinion, see you holding up these
fingers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No, no. I made sure of that because I had my hand down like
this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you had your hand down you are putting it in front of
your belt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. As well as I could remember I had it down kind of like this
here. I don't know whether I used my right or my left hand, but I didn't hold
up three fingers like this, but I held them down just about like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to your right hand and putting it somewhat
about a few inches above the buckle of your belt; is that about where you held
up your fingers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. About as well as I could remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened after you held up your fingers, did someone see
you holding your fingers up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where were they standing beside you so that they
could see your fingers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, this gentleman was standing over back a piece to my left,
sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was it close to you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. There was one man on my right. He was Secret Service or
FBI, I think FBI; and the other man was a policeman, Dallas policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know whether Mr. Whaley was making his identification
at the same time that you did or did he make it before or after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No. All I know is that we viewed them at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He viewed them at the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You don't know at what time Mr. Whaley made his identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You didn't see him make the identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I didn't even see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You don't know what his identification was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No. I never asked him which one or nothing, because I never
did discuss it with him at all after that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you brought your cab up to the corner of 10th
and Patton, did you just conclude or had you just concluded dropping a
passenger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, approximately five minutes before that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you keep a record of the trips that you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. During your working day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir. If I pick up a passenger, say, like 28 minutes to 12
o'clock, we put 20 minutes to 12. We don't put the odd minutes down.</p>

<p>If we let him out 2 minutes after 12, we put down 12 o'clock. I know I let him
out at 1 o'clock, maybe a minute or two after. We do put the destination we
leave from and the destination he is going to on our records sheet.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What does your record show about this last trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well, I picked him up at Love Field and carried him to 321
North Ewing, as well as I can remember now, that was the address.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And your record shows that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. When I picked him up, the mileage started from, the mileage
I let him out on the speedometer. When I picked him up we put the mileage
down. We don't put the tenth down, and when we let him out we put the
mileage and the time; and when we pick him up we put the mileage and the
time, and the destination where we start and where we let him off, and the
amount the fare was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And your last entry shows what for that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I don't know what the last entry was. Up until then that was
the one where I let the man off at. It was an apartment building. Of course,
I don't have the apartment number, anything like that. The guy says, "I want
to go to 321 North Ewing," and that is where I take him. It is an apartment.
Of course now, if somebody calls in for a cab at a certain address, if it is an
apartment, they have to give their apartment number so we could find it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How far was this last destination to the point of 10th
and Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It was less than a mile, about a half mile or maybe&mdash;well, let's
see, it was closer to a mile, I would say.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was there any particular reason why you went to the
corner of 10th and Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. I belong to that club there, and I was going around
there to get me a coca cola that I could have gotten anywhere else, but I know
a lot of the guys.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What is the club called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It is a gentleman's club, a domino parlor where we play
dominos.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is at what address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. 123 or 125 South Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About where is it in relation to East 10th and Patton, how far
away, a block, two blocks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It is not a block. It is just about, I would say, just&mdash;if it
was measured it would be a little over a half block from where I was parked
at to the place, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder, perhaps, if we can see it on any of these pictures, Mr.
Scoggins. Do you see it in this picture, Exhibit 530?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; I can see the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let's see the building here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. That is it up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I wonder if we can't, perhaps, put on Exhibit 530 an arrow which
points to this building, and we will put "G" for the gentleman's club; is that
correct? Is that the building to which you are referring?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Scoggins, we have another picture that we would like to
have you identify, Commission Exhibit 534. This is a picture in which the
camera appears to be heading in what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It would be heading east&mdash;I mean west on 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That picture was taken the other day at the time you drove your
cab back to that scene, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. I would think it was; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does this appear to be the position your cab was in at the time
of the shooting of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. At this time we offer and introduce into evidence all
exhibits up through 534, except we do not have a 533 because we renumbered
the original Exhibit 533, so we do not have a 533.</p>

<p>Do you have anything more, Congressman Ford?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Those exhibits will be admitted.</p>

<p>(Items identified as Commission Exhibits through No. 534, with the exception
of Exhibit No. 533, were admitted in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Scoggins, you have referred, I believe, to a conversation
you had with Mr. Whaley, I think his name is, and I would like to have you
just recount what you recall of what Mr. Whaley said to you, and where he
said it, and at what time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Well now, this conversation we are talking about, while we
were down there waiting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Down where, down at the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No; down at the cab office&mdash;it is a cab office at 610 South
Akard Street, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. A cab stand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. We call it our main office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And Mr. Whaley's cab belonged to the same company as your
cab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes, sir. Only he drives out of downtown, which office is 610
South Akard Street, that is the number. They have a building there, a large
building, with all the dispatching offices and everything, and mine, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
I have got the same dispatchers, we all belong to the same company. I drive an
Oak Cliff cab, and he drives downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Relate what Mr. Whaley said to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He didn't relate it to me. He was talking to the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He was talking to cabdrivers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He was talking to one of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where did this take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. It was down at the cabstand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was this on Saturday after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. And he was telling them where he picked him up and where
he took him to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And that is what you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes; because I didn't know him. I wasn't acquainted with
the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were not acquainted with Mr. Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. No. Before he came down there that morning I wouldn't have
known him from Adam, you know, just wouldn't have had any idea who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you recall what he said as to where he picked up the
man and where he took him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. He said he picked him up at the Greyhound bus and carried
him to a neighborhood, no particular address, on North Beckley, the 500 block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Have you anything more on that, Mr. Belin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, sir. I do have one other question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Proceed then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not your dispatcher recorded any
time on his sheets as to the time you called in after the Tippit shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. When I was down there giving my statement to my supervisor,
he asked me what time it was, and I said I don't have any idea, so he picked
up the phone and called the dispatcher, and he said it was 1:23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is the time that he recorded it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes. He must have recorded it up there because he said it
was 1:23 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you called in after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scoggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Any further questions? Well, thank you very much, Mr.
Scoggins.</p>

<h2 id="hm2">TESTIMONY OF HELEN MARKHAM RESUMED</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were sworn when you previously were before us, and this
testimony of yours will be covered by the oath you previously have given. Will
you be seated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have two Commission Exhibits, 535 and 536. I will show them
to you, Mrs. Markham, and I will ask you if you have ever seen the man who
is pictured there, whose picture is shown on these two exhibits.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Never have seen him before. Do you think he might have been
one of the men you talked to before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They are pictures of the same man.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We are inquiring whether you had ever seen him after the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, I know. No; not this man. This man I have never
seen&mdash;I have never seen this man in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know who he is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I don't. It is just a picture of a man; I don't know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Ball, do you have any further questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No further questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you ever had any difficulty with the law, Mrs.
Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. None whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Traffic violations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are lucky.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I have never been in trouble.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No difficulties whatsoever with the law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is all, Mrs. Markham. You can be excused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much, Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I offer Exhibits 535 and 536 in evidence at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They will be received.</p>

<p>(The items identified as Commission Exhibits Nos. 535 and 536 were received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were taken from a newspaper, they were taken from newspaper
accounts which purported to be, to show, the picture of a man named
Mark Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes, because he appeared before this Commission, did he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Redlich, can you identify him? Were you present when Mr.
Lane appeared before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Can you identify these pictures as pictures of Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes; I can identify these as pictures of Mr. Lane. I would
also like for the record to indicate where they came from. Commission Exhibit
No. 535 is taken from&mdash;Commission Exhibit 536 came from the San Francisco
Chronicle, and dated February 8, 1964, and purports to be a photograph of
Mark Lane.</p>

<p>Commission No. 535 is a photograph from a newspaper clipping which was
in the Commission files, and it is an Associated Press photograph, and appeared,
it is taken from the New York Herald Tribune of March 5, 1964, and purports
to be a photograph of Mark Lane. I have met Mr. Lane once or twice prior
to his appearance before this Commission, and I was present during his testimony
before this Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You identify these as pictures of Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. These are photographs of Mark Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And these Exhibits 535 and 536 were the exhibits which were
presented to Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think the record should show how they were presented. They
were clipped out so there was not any writing or anything to indicate whom
they were pictures of on their face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is on the record.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham, there is a short question that Congressman Ford wanted to
put to you.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What kind of eyesight do you have, Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. I have always had good eyesight.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you wear glasses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have your eyes tested recently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No; I haven't. I have no cause to.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You have never worn glasses in your lifetime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Are you farsighted, nearsighted, or neither, just good-sighted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Just good-sighted. I did a lot of writing and a cashier and
everything. I see pretty good.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. If you go to a movie can you see the picture easily and
well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Oh, yes; yes, sir; real well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You can see things at a distance quite well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markham</span>. Yes, sir. I have never had glasses.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="bjd">TESTIMONY OF MRS. BARBARA JEANETTE DAVIS</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Davis, you didn't get the notice through the mail asking you
to appear here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We told you orally in Washington, or in Dallas last Friday, didn't
we?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She has not been sworn. Will you kindly raise your right hand?
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give to this Commission is the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Davis, you didn't get a letter from the Commission asking
you to appear here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But when Mr. Belin and I were in Dallas on Friday of last week
we asked you to appear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. On Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Saturday, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is right. And you voluntarily agreed to come up here, didn't
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Without any notice from the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Athens, Tex.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Athens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far through school did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Halfway through the 10th midterm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then did you get married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were living in Dallas on November 22, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was your address there in Dallas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. 400 East 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was living with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. You mean in the apartment or in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the apartment with you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Just my husband and two children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had a sister, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Virginia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was she living there at the time, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. They lived around the side of the apartment house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the same building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was your husband's sister?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No; it was my husband's brother's wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Husband's brother's wife. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have got some pictures here so we will understand. I will show
you Exhibit 525. Is the house in which you were living on November 22d
shown in the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is the one on the corner? The southeast corner of 10th and
Patton, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I don't know anything about that, but I know where it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you Commission Exhibit 524. Is the house shown in
that picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And I show you 534, is the house shown in that picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I am showing you 528 and there is a lawn there, that is the lawn
of what house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Of the house I lived in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The house you lived in.</p>

<p>On that day did something unusual happen that you observed, on November
22d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Those gunshots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Gunshots? Where were you when you heard gunshots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. In bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you say gunshot or gunshots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Plural? How many did you hear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Just two, they were pretty close together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were lying on the bed. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I got up, put my shoes on to see what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever go outdoors?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. At first, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went to the door, did you open the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I opened the door and held the screen opened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Mrs. Markham standing across the street over there, and she was
standing over there and the man was coming across the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A man was coming across what yard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. My yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you see the man doing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, first off she went to screaming before I had paid too much
attention to him, and pointing at him, and he was, what I thought, was emptying
the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had a gun in his hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he was emptying it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was open and he had his hands cocked like he was emptying it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Which hand did he have it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To his left palm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him throw anything away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He looked at her first and looked at me and then smiled and went
around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he running or walking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was walking at his normal pace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he went around the corner?</p>

<p>Did he go on the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes. He was on the sidewalk right beside the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he go, did he cut across your lawn at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He cut across the middle of the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Here is a diagram, 523, this is 400&mdash;that is your home.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He came right across like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Came across like this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Ran beside the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is already a mark on there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He left the sidewalk about here, just on the other side of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, mark on the picture now, photo 21 which is Commission Exhibit
534, and you just take this and mark with it and show where he left the
sidewalk and what course he took.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was just parallel to the side of this and right around this little
bush and around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Around the corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The black mark from the sidewalk on 534 marks the course that
the man took?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could you tell us where you were standing when you
saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I was standing on the porch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put an "X" there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I can't see the porch. The door is right between these two things
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. These two things&mdash;what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Between the two posts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Two posts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's get a better view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It seems to be the best.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are right.</p>

<p>That is 525.</p>

<p>Now mark where he cut across on that with a line.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Right across like this, only it would be on the other side of the
bushes here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>And where were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Standing right&mdash;here is the door right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put an "X" there. That "X" is a mark to locate your position and we
will give a symbol to it. "D." Now, the line you have drawn from the sidewalk
through the bushes is the course the man took. Where was he when you saw
him emptying his gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was right here on the other side of this bush.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Draw a line through the course there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Just about along in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you know at the time he was emptying his gun?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That is what I presumed because he had it open and was shaking
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see. Just right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, there is a cross you make across the line that he
took which marks the place where he was emptying the gun.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Just about halfway there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mark it also on 21, 534.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Not quite half, not quite to the bushes there.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Ball, even though she cannot pinpoint the point
where she was standing because of the photograph, she might draw an arrow
showing about where she was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Show an arrow about where you were standing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. About there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is 21, photo 21 and Commission Exhibit 534.</p>

<p>After the man left, what did you do, after he went out of sight what did you
do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I went back in and phoned the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you tell the police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I just told them that a policeman had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I came back outside and walked down to where the policeman's
car was out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the policeman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was laying on the left-hand side of the car on the ground,
by the left-hand fender.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he alive or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he talk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't know whether he was alive or dead?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; I didn't get that close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Not 5 minutes, I would imagine, because the police cars started
coming, so I went back to my yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a man coming and get the policeman's gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you later look in the bushes and find something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; in the grass beside the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The grass beside the house. What did you find?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We found one shell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And your sister-in-law, did your sister-in-law find something else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She found one later in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One, later?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you show me on one of these pictures here where you found
one shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Under the window here. That would be the only one I could tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The only one that shows, it is photo 3, it is Commission Exhibit
534. Draw an arrow down.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Right Under that window there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Under that window.</p>

<p>The arrow which is marked "D-1" shows the position where you found one
shell. Did you see your sister-in-law find the other shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that found?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. There is a little cement walk right here by her door, it was right
there, not too far from there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you draw an arrow down to show the approximate position?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was almost in front of her door, there is a little cement porch
to step up to her door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The arrow which we marked as "D-2" marks the place where your
sister-in-law found the second shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You only found two shells, did you, you one and your sister-in-law
one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time of day did you find the one shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I don't know. This was probably an hour and a half, maybe 2
hours, after the officer was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time of day did your sister-in-law find her shell, find the
shell that she found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Somewhere around 4:30, 5, somewhere in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you later go down to the police station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you shown a group of people in the police station and asked
if you could identify the man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you alone in that room when you were shown these people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. My husband, my sister-in-law was with me, and some other men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is your husband Troy, your sister-in-law Virginia Davis, and
yourself, and other men?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know those men?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were police officers there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. They were all in suits, some sat at the back of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When those&mdash;how many men were shown to you in this lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they of the same size or of different sizes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Most of them was about the same size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All white men, were they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you recognize anyone in that room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir. I recognized number 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Number 2 you recognized? Did you tell any policeman there anything
after you recognized them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I told the man who had brought us down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That I thought number 2 was the man that I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That you saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By number 2, was the man you saw the man you saw doing what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Unloading the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And going across your yard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was about what time of day that you were at the lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was after 8, I am sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. After 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On what day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. On Friday, the same day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The same day? It was after 8 o'clock on Friday, the same day
that you had seen the man unloading the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Have you any way of fixing the time of when the man ran
across your lawn, approximately?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; not exactly because I had laid down with the children
and I didn't pay any attention to what time it was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You saw him take the shells out of the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; he was shaking them.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He was shaking them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was shaking them. I didn't see him actually use his hand
to take them out. I mean he was sort of shaking them out.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you find this one bullet at the point where you saw
him shake the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; it was around the side of the house.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. About how many feet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I don't know. Not too far.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But he had moved from the one point to where you
found the bullets?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That is where they started looking for it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I meant the shells rather than the bullets.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he dressed the same in the lineup as he was when you saw
him running across the lawn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. All except he didn't have a black coat on when I saw him in the
lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have a coat on when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What color coat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. A dark coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you recognize him from his face or from his clothes when
you saw him in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, I looked at his clothes and then his face from the side
because I had seen him from a side view of him. I didn't see him fullface.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now answer the question. Did you recognize him from seeing
his face or from his clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. From his face because that was all I was looking at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. Now, when you heard the shots you were lying down,
were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was anyone lying with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Virginia was laying on the couch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the same room with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did she go to the door with you when you went to the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She went right behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have a jacket, I would like to show you, which is Commission
Exhibit No. 162. Does this look anything like the jacket that the man had
on that was going across your lawn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How is it different?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, it was dark and to me it looked like it was maybe a wool
fabric, it looked sort of rough. Like more of a sporting jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a shirt which is Commission Exhibit No. 150. Was
that&mdash;does that shirt look anything like something he had on, that the man
had on who went across your lawn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I thought that the shirt he had on was lighter than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions. Where was Mrs. Markham when
you first saw her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She was standing right here on this corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That picture that you refer to is photo number 3, Commission Exhibit
524.</p>

<p>It is as shown on the corner here, as the woman who is shown in the corner?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That was her position.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Do you wear glasses, Mrs. Davis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you had your eyes examined recently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I believe it was in October when I applied for some driver's
license.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In October of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You applied for a driver's license?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I believe it was the first&mdash;some time in October, I believe.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you applied for a driver's license in Texas you
have to take an examination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you did take one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did they recommend that you wear glasses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir. He said my eyes are all right.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He said your eyes were all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Have you had any problems with the law at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Except for traffic violations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you. What is your husband's occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He is a roofer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Puts shingles and roofs on houses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Oh, yes, surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Davis, before you went down to look at the man at the
police station at 8 o'clock that night, had you seen television pictures of the
man on television that he had been arrested?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. As far as I can remember I don't remember seeing it because
I was out in the yard all the time that was going on, and I don't believe
the TV was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before you saw the man in the lineup were you shown a picture
of any man by a police officer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you read a newspaper and see any pictures in a newspaper,
picture of a man in the newspaper, before you went down there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I don't really know. I couldn't be quite sure. I can't remember
whether I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you take an evening or a morning paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We take an afternoon paper, we took an afternoon paper then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recall whether or not you did see a picture in the paper
of the man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I don't remember. I don't even remember whether I read it
or not. There was so much excitement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When the man ran over the lawn, can you give me an estimate
of how far away he was from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Make a judgment about it as to this room. Is it as far away
from you to me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was about as far as here to the corner of the room out there,
or just a little bit more, the far corner.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Just a little less, did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. About like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About seven or eight steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About 20, 25 feet, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is an affidavit that has been filed with us, a statement you
made to the Secret Service men on the first of December 1963. And in that
affidavit, it says, after describing that "The man was on the sidewalk directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
in front of me and shaking shells from a pistol into his hand as he walked,"&mdash;this
says here, "The man was walking in a normal direction and walked across
the corner of my property towards Patton Street."</p>

<p>Did you ever tell anyone that you saw the man walking in a normal direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No; I showed them where it was at, and they done that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. He was walking&mdash;what direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I didn't know. And so they figured that out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was walking towards what street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was going down Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Towards what street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Jefferson. And so they figured it out for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. However&mdash;when&mdash;did you see the man after he went around the
corner of your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you see the taxicab parked on the corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's go back to that afternoon, and you give your best memory
of what the man looked like. Don't think of what anybody has told you or
what has happened in between. Try to remember the vision you had of
that man&mdash;the color of his hair, the size of his build and so forth.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. You mean weight and like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was white, wasn't he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Light complexioned, or dark?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was more light complected than he would have been dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Color of his hair?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was either dark brown or black. It was just dark hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the color of his clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, I said he had on&mdash;he looked to me that he had on dark
trousers, and it looked like a light colored shirt, with a dark coat over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what age would you say the man was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I am not very good on that. I don't know. I would say he
was about 23, 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what about his weight and height?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have to be general, I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just your best recollection. If you haven't any, just tell us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I just don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he fat or slender?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was slender built, and not very heavy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he a tall man, or a real short man, or average?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Oh, he wasn't especially tall. I would say he was about medium
height or a little taller. I mean he wasn't extra tall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you have some difficulty in identifying this No. 2 man
in the showup when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, they made us look at him a long time before they let
us say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about you? I am not talking about what you told them.</p>

<p>What was your reaction when you saw this man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they
made him turn sideways, I was positive that was the one I seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Thank you, Mrs. Davis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did your sister-in-law go with you to the lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she make an identification?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At the same time as you did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you see her identification?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We didn't discuss it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I mean, but after she had made it, did you see what identification
she had made?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Do you mean&mdash;I don't understand what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Well, let me start over again.</p>

<p>Did you identify the man in the lineup before your sister-in-law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Before your sister-in-law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; I was the first one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Did your sister-in-law, to your knowledge, make the same identification?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; she was there with me at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She was standing with you. And she saw the identification you
had made?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. All I done was just lean over and tell the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How did you make your identification? By pointing or holding
up your fingers.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The man that was sitting next to me just asked me which one
I thought it was, and I leaned over and told him. And then he leaned around
me and asked her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He did what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He leaned around&mdash;he was behind me, and asked her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I sort of set up where he could talk to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And did you identify the man by number or by pointing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. By number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you remember what number it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was number 2. From the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Have you any questions?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you whisper this information to the man behind
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, we were all sitting in a line, and he was sitting on this
side of me. He just leaned over and asked me which one I thought it was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He was sitting on your right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you turned to your right and told him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And your sister-in-law was sitting on your left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. On the other side, yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you spoke to him, you were speaking away from
her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you speak in a loud voice or a whisper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; very quietly.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You think your sister-in-law heard you say the number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Attorney General, have you any questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span>. Thank you, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murray</span>. I have no questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think the record should show that although the witness did not
receive the letter notifying her of our request for an appearance, we mailed
it to her last known address at 400 East 10th Street, and the letter came back
here. But the notice was mailed to the witness. It was just that it was not
forwarded to where she now lives in Athens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You had moved from this house where these incidents took
place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are excused. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Our next witness is Mr. Ted Callaway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>

<h2 id="tc">TESTIMONY OF TED CALLAWAY</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Callaway, in the absence of the Chief Justice, I am presiding
over the meeting of the Commission this morning.</p>

<p>Would you kindly raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you swear that the testimony that you will give to this Commission is
the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You may be seated.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball, will you proceed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Callaway, we are investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. We are going to ask you questions with regard to what you saw on
the day of November 22, 1963, in Dallas.</p>

<p>Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. 805 West Eighth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Car salesman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We would like to know something about your background. We
ask most of the witnesses these questions.</p>

<p>Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. In Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you raised in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Went to school in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Forty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far through school did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Two years of college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. S.M.U.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do after you got out of college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I worked part time as a clothing salesman downtown, and
then my uncle was a painter, and I worked for him for awhile. Then I went
back in the Marines for 3 years.</p>

<p>And I have been selling cars since '56.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are a used-car salesman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you employed&mdash;have you had any trouble with the
police of any sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any difficulty at all in your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No, sir; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were discharged from the Marines, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Received an honorable discharge from the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, where were you working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. At Harris Bros., auto sales.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was your job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I was used-car manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Harris Bros. Auto Sales is located where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. 501 East Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is that from 10th and Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Just one block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One block south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What corner?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. It would be on the northeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So that we can orient ourselves from 10th and Patton&mdash;I have
marked this diagram as Commission Exhibit 537.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 537 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Mr. Callaway, will you, on 537, take this and mark the location
of the used car lot with an "X"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The "X" marks the position of the used-car lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Mr. Callaway, around 1:15 or so of that day, where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I was standing on the front porch of our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is at 401 East Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No; 501.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I will show you a picture which we will mark as 538.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 538 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does this show a picture of the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you went down there one day last week to have some pictures
taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you attempt to stand in the same place you were at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where you were standing November 22d around 1 o'clock or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I heard what sounded to me like five pistol shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Five pistol shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Five shots, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the sound, could you tell the source of the sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir, I could tell it was back of the lot over toward 10th
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I ran out to the sidewalk on Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Well, I could see&mdash;I was still&mdash;before I got to the sidewalk,
I could see this taxicab parked down on Patton. I saw the cabdriver beside his
cab, and saw a man cutting from one side of the street to the other. That would
be the east side of Patton and over to the west side of Patton. And he was
running. And he had a gun in his hand, his right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how was he holding the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. We used to say in the Marine Corps in a raised pistol position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be with the muzzle pointed upward, and with the arm
bent at the elbow, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir; just like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have a picture here, 539.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 539 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When this picture was taken, did you try to represent the place
you were standing when you saw the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I ran.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You ran from the place on the porch, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. That is right. From right here, to there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you were at the place shown on 538, on the porch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when you heard the shots, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I just hurried&mdash;I don't know whether I really ran or not.
But I hurried off the side of this porch and came to this position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. When you came to this position, you say you saw a
taxicab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where is this position on this chart? Right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. It would be about right here. I come off the porch here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Point 29?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw a taxicab where, on photo 29?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's mark an arrow there, about where you saw the taxicab. The
arrow marks the position of the taxicab. You saw a man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was crossing Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that to the south or the north of the taxicab? Closer to you
than the taxicab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he running or walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. He was running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where were you when you noticed he had the gun? Or where
was he when you noticed he had the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. When I first saw the gun, he had already crossed from here
to here and was coming up this sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Coming up the sidewalk on which side of Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. West side of Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did he continue to come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you say anything to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I hollered "Hey, man, what the hell is going on?" When he
was right along here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Make a mark there where he was when you yelled, "What the hell
is going on?" "X" marks the place where the man with the gun was when
you yelled at him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you mark it on this chart, too&mdash;Exhibit 537?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Right along here&mdash;about 27. I guess. That would be it. You
see, here is where I was, sir. And then he was right there when I hollered at
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I don't get this. There is an alleyway there, apparently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But here is where the squad car was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And here is where the cab was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He had come all the way down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. He had come from there through this yard and cut behind
this taxicab, over to this side of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So he was there, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No, sir. I didn't holler at him until he came up to here.
He was running up this sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He was going south on Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. On the west side of the street.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You saw him run from about the <span class="locked">taxicab&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Across the street, up this sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. About how far is that? Fifty feet or more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Oh, it is more than that. From here down to there, I think
is about 300 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mark on this diagram, which is 537, where the man was, and the
course he took.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Well, now, when I first saw him he was right here. Then he
came across here, down this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Down to the point where you spoke to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he do when you hollered at him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. He slowed his pace, almost halted for a minute. And he said
something to me, which I could not understand. And then kind of shrugged his
shoulders, and kept on going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Show the course he took on the map, if you will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Right on down here, and he cut through this front yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where was he when you last saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the first "X" marks the position of the parking lot&mdash;we will
mark that 1. The place of the taxicab we will mark as 2. The place where
the man was with the gun when you yelled at him, we will mark that as 3. The
last place you saw the man, that we will mark 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask what course he was taking when you last saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. He was going west on Jefferson Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. West on Jefferson Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I hollered to this guy behind&mdash;B.&nbsp;D. Searcy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you say to Mr. Searcy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I told him to keep an eye on that guy, I says, "Keep an eye
on that guy, follow him. I am going to go down there and see what is going
on." So I ran, a good hard run, from here down around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 10th and Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got there what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I saw a squad car, and by that time there was four or five
people that had gathered, a couple of cars had stopped. Then I saw&mdash;I went
on up to the squad car and saw the police officer lying in the street. I see he
had been shot in the head. So the first thing I did, I ran over to the squad
car. I didn't know whether anybody reported it or not. So I got on the police
radio and called them, and told them a man had been shot, told them the location,
I thought the officer was dead. They said we know about it, stay off the air, so
I went back.</p>

<p>By this time an ambulance was coming. The officer was laying on his left
side, his pistol was underneath him. I kind of rolled him over and took his
gun out from under him. The people wonder whether he ever got his pistol out of
his holster. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The pistol was out of the holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir; out of the holster, and it was unsnapped. It was
on his right side. He was laying with the gun under him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I picked the gun up and laid it on the hood of the squad car,
and then someone put it in the front seat of the squad car. Then after I helped
load Officer Tippit in the ambulance, I got the gun out of the car and told this
cabdriver, I said, "You saw the guy didn't you?" He said, yes.</p>

<p>I said, "If he is going up Jefferson, he can't be very far. Let's see if we can
find him." So I went with Scoggins in the taxicab, went up to 10th, Crawford,
from Crawford up to Jefferson, and down Jefferson to Beckley. And we turned
on Beckley. If we had kept going up Jefferson, we probably&mdash;there is a good
chance we would have seen him, because he was headed right towards the Texas
Theatre. But then we circled around several blocks, and ended up coming back
to where it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the ambulance&mdash;had the ambulance been there by that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Oh, yes; the ambulance already left before I ever left with
the cabdriver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down to the police station later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. That evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I think it was around 6:30 or 7 o'clock. I remember it was
after dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down there alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No. I went with Sam Guinyard, a colored porter of ours.
He saw him, also.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. We drove down. Officer&mdash;Detective Jim Leavelle met us, and
took us into this room where they showed us the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, before you went down there, had you seen any newspaper
accounts of this incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No, sir; I had been out there on the lot. I hadn't seen a
newspaper, hadn't even heard a radio, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you seen any television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you seen a picture of a man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The officer show you any pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went into a police lineup, in a room where they had a lineup
of men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were they all the same size, or different sizes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. They were about the same build, but the man that I identified
was the shortest one of the bunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they anywhere near the same age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. They were about the same age, yes, sir. They looked&mdash;you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you say you identified a man. How did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell us what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. We first went into the room. There was Jim Leavelle, the
detective, Sam Guinyard, and then this busdriver and myself. We waited
down there for probably 20 or 30 minutes. And Jim told us, "When I show
you these guys, be sure, take your time, see if you can make a positive
identification."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you known him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No. And he said, "We want to be sure, we want to try to
wrap him up real tight on killing this officer. We think he is the same one
that shot the President. But if we can wrap him up tight on killing this
officer, we have got him." So they brought four men in.</p>

<p>I stepped to the back of the room, so I could kind of see him from the same
distance which I had seen him before. And when he came out, I knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean he looked like the same man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what distance was he away from you&mdash;the closest that he
ever was to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. About 56 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You measured that, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Last Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Measured it with a tape measure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have the same clothes on in the lineup&mdash;did the man have
the same clothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. He had the same trousers and shirt, but he didn't have his
jacket on. He had ditched his jacket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind&mdash;when you talked to the police officers before you saw
this man, did you give them a description of the clothing he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell them you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I told them he had some dark trousers and a light tannish
gray windbreaker jacket, and I told him that he was fair complexion, dark hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell them the size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes; I told them&mdash;I think I told them about 5'10".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you see his front face at any time, or did you only have a
side view of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. He looked right at me, sir. When I called to him, he looked
right at me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You saw front face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have a jacket here&mdash;Commission's Exhibit No. 162. Does this
look anything like the jacket that the man had on that you saw across the
street with a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes; it sure does. Yes, that is the same type jacket. Actually,
I thought it had a little more tan to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Same type?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a shirt, 150. Does it look anything like the shirt he
had on under the jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Sir, when I saw him he didn't have&mdash;I couldn't see this shirt.
I saw&mdash;he had it open. That shirt was open, and I could see his white T-shirt
underneath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had a white T-shirt underneath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes. That is the shirt he had on in the lineup that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he fat or thin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. He was <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I mean the man you saw across the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Just a nice athletic type size boy, I mean. Neither fat nor
thin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you estimate his weight when you talked to the officer
before the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. I told him it looked to me like around 160 pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How fast was he going when you hailed him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Just a good steady trot, not real fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He was not walking and not running&mdash;it was a trot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. A trot; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He stopped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Almost. He slowed down, like a guy is trotting along, and
he almost stopped, and kept going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And he looked at you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir; he said something, but I could not understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You could not understand what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. That is right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And then did he resume his progress at a trot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever ask Searcy if he followed him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. He didn't follow him.</p>

<p>He said something about "Follow him, hell. That man will kill you. He
has a gun."</p>

<p>So instead of following him, he went back over and got behind the office
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he see him at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes; he saw him the same time I did; yes, sir. I never could
figure out why he didn't just follow that man. You could follow 50 yards
behind him and keep a guy in sight. Chances are you wouldn't get killed 50
yards away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Had you had previous military service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. Yes, sir; I was in the Marine Corps 6 years, World War II,
and during Korea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you ever tangle with the law in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What years were you in the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. 1942 through '45, and then '51 through '54.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were you in Korea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Callaway</span>. No, sir; I didn't go to Korea. I was at Camp Pendleton as
a troop trainer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to offer to Exhibit 539, inclusive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Can you tell me what the numbers are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 537, 538, and 539.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Exhibits 537, 538, and 539 previously identified will now be
admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 537 through 539 were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much. We appreciate your coming.</p>

Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I attended grade school and high school in Denton, Tex.;
received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from North Texas State University
in 1947; received my M.D. from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
School in 1961; served an internship at Parkland Memorial Hospital from
1961 to 1962; and then did a year of fellowship at the surgery department at
Southwestern Medical School, followed by my surgery residency at Parkland
Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you duly licensed to practice medicine in the State of Texas,
Dr. Carrico?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you board certified at the present time or are you working
toward the board certification in surgery?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I am engaged in surgery residency which will qualify me
for board certification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What experience have you had, if any, with gunshot wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. In the emergency room at Parkland, during my residence school
and internship and residency, we have seen a fair number of gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you approximate the number of gunshot wounds you
have treated in the course of those duties?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. In all probably 150, 200, something in that range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your duties at Parkland Memorial Hospital on
November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At that time I was assigned to the elective surgery service,
which is the general surgery service treating the usual surgical cases. I was
in the emergency room evaluating some patient for admission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were you doing specifically in the neighborhood of 12:30
p.m. on that day?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At that time I had been called to the emergency room to
evaluate a patient for admission to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you notified that an emergency case involving President
Kennedy was en route to the hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to the time that you were notified
that President Kennedy was en route to the hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Shortly after 12:30 is the best I can do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long thereafter was it that he actually did arrive at
Parkland, to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Within 2 minutes approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And precisely where were you at Parkland when you first
observed him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. When I first observed him I was in the emergency room, seeing&mdash;actually
Governor Connally had been brought in first, as you know, Dr.
Dulany and I had gone to care for Governor Connally and when the President
was brought in I left Governor Connally and went to care for the
President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe briefly the physical layout of Parkland with
respect to the point where emergency cases are brought up to the building and
the general layout of the building into the emergency room.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. The emergency entrance is at the back of the building. There
is an ambulance ramp. Then immediately adjacent to the ambulance ramp
are, of course, double doors, swinging doors and a corridor which is approximately
30 feet long and empties directly into the emergency room.</p>

<p>Then inside the emergency room are several areas, the surgical area consists
of about eight booths for treating, examination and treatment of patients, and
four large emergency operating rooms.</p>

<p>Two of these are specifically set aside for acutely ill, severely ill, patients
and these are referred to as trauma rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were these trauma rooms used in connection with the treatment
of President Kennedy and Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What precisely was the point where you met at his arrival?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. The President was being wheeled into trauma room one when I
saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who else, if anyone, was present at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At that time, Dr. Don Curtis, Martin White.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Was he a doctor, too?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir; Miss Bowron.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who is Miss Bowron?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. She is one of the nurses on duty at the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was the first doctor to actually see the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what did you observe as to the condition of President Kennedy
when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. He was on an ambulance cart, emergency cart, rather. His
color was blue white, ashen. He had slow agonal respiration, spasmodic respirations
without any coordination. He was making no voluntary movements.
His eyes were open, pupils were seen to be dilated and later were seen not to
react to light. This was the initial impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the status of his pulse at the time of arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. He had no palpable pulse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was he making any movements at the time of arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No voluntary movements, only the spasmodic respirations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was any heartbeat noted at his arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. After these initial observations we opened his shirt, coat, listened
very briefly to his chest, heard a few sounds which we felt to be heartbeats and
then proceeded with the remainder of the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In your opinion was President Kennedy alive or dead on his
arrival at Parkland.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. From a medical standpoint I suppose he was still alive in that he
did still have a heartbeat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action, if any, was taken with respect to the removal
of President Kennedy's clothing?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As I said after I had opened his shirt and coat, I proceeded
with the examination and the nurses removed his clothing as is the usual
procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was President Kennedy wearing a back brace?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe as precisely as you can that back brace?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As I recall, this was a white cotton or some sort of fiber standard
brace with stays and corset, in a corset-type arrangement and buckles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far up on his body did it come?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Just below his umbilicus, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far down on his body did it go?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I did not examine below his belt at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you at any time examine below his belt?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I did not; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know if anyone else did?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Not in a formal manner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action did you take by way of treating President Kennedy
on his arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. After what we have described we completed an initial emergency
examination, which consisted of, as we have already said, his color, his
pulse, we felt his back, determined there were no large wounds which would
be an immediate threat to life there. Looked very briefly at the head wound
and then because of his inadequate respirations inserted an endotracheal tube
to attempt to support these respirations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Specifically what did you do with respect to the back, Dr. Carrico?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This is a routine examination of critically ill patients where
you haven't got time to examine him fully. I just placed my hands just above
the belt, but in this case just above the brace, and ran my hands up his back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To what point on his body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. All the way up to his neck very briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you feel by that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I felt nothing other than the blood and debris. There was no
large wound there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What source did you attribute the blood to at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As it could have come from the head wound, and it certainly
could have been a back wound, but there was no way to tell whether this blood
would have come from a back wound and not from his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action did you next take then?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At that time the endotracheal tube was inserted, using a curved
laryngoscopic blade, inserting an endotracheal tube, it was seen there were some
contusions, hematoma to the right of the larynx, with a minimal deviation of the
larynx to the left, and ragged tissue below indicating tracheal injury.</p>

<p>The tube was inserted past this injury, and the cuff inflater was connected
to a Bennett machine which is a respiratory assistor using positive pressure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe briefly what you mean in lay terms by a
cuffed endotracheal tube?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This is a plastic tube which is inserted into the trachea, into the
windpipe, to allow an adequate airway, adequate breathing. The cuff is a small
latex cuff which should prevent leakage of air around the tube, thus insuring
an adequate airway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you continue, then, to describe what efforts you made to
revive the President.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. After the endotracheal tube was inserted and connected, I listened
briefly to his chest, respirations were better but still inadequate.</p>

<p>Dr. Perry arrived, and because of the inadequate respirations the presence of
a tracheal injury, advised that the chest tube was to be inserted, this was done
by some of the other physicians in the room.</p>

<p>At the same time we had been getting the airway inserted Dr. Curtis and
Dr. White were doing a cutdown, venous section using polyethylene catheters
through which fluid, medicine and blood could be administered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe in lay language what you mean by a cutdown
in relationship to what they did in this case?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This was a small incision over his ankle and a tube was inserted
into one of his veins through which blood could be given, fluid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is the general purpose of that to maintain a circulatory system?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In wounded parties?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you now proceed again to describe what else was done
for the President in an effort to save his life?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Sure. Dr. Perry then took over supervision and treatment, and
the chest tubes were inserted, another cutdown was done by Dr. Jones on the
President's arm.</p>

<p>Fluid, as I said, was given, blood was given, hydrocortisone was given. Dr.
Clark, the chief neurosurgeon, Dr. Bashour, cardiologist, was there or arrived,
and a cardiac monitor was attached and although I never saw any electro-activity,
Dr. Clark said there was some electrical activity of the heart which
means he was still trying <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is Dr. Clark's position in the hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. He is chief of the neurosurgery department and professor of the
neurosurgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Carrico, will you continue to tell us then what treatment
you rendered the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. When this electrocardiac activity ceased, close cardiac massage
was begun. Using this, and fluids and airway we were able to maintain
fairly good color, apparently fairly good peripheral circulation as monitored
by carotid and radial pulses for a period of time. These efforts were abandoned
when it was determined by Dr. Clark that there was no continued cardiac response.
There was no cerebral response, that is the pupils remained dilated
and fixed; there was evidence of anoxia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe in lay language what anoxia means?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No oxygen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was cardiac massage applied in this situation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir; it was, excellent cardiac massage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were bloods administered to the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Carrico, was any action taken with respect to the adrenalin
insufficiency of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir; he was given 300 milligrams of hydrocortisone which is
an adrenal hormone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the reason for the administration of that drug?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. It was recalled that the President had been said to have adrenal
insufficiency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, at what time was the death of the President pronounced,
Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who pronounced the death of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Dr. Clark, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that a precise time fixed or a general time fixed for
the point of death?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This was a general time, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, in your opinion, was the cause of death?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. The head wound, the head injury.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe as specifically as you can the head wound
which you have already mentioned briefly?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>This was a 5- by 71-cm defect in the posterior skull, the occipital region.
There was an absence of the calvarium or skull in this area, with shredded
tissue, brain tissue present and initially considerable slow oozing. Then after
we established some circulation there was more profuse bleeding from this
wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was any other wound observed on the head in addition to this
large opening where the skull was absent?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No other wound on the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any opportunity specifically to look for a small
wound which was below the large opening of the skull on the right side of the
head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir; at least initially there was no time to examine the
patient completely for all small wounds. As we said before, this was an acutely
ill patient and all we had time to do was to determine what things were life-threatening
right then and attempt to resuscitate him and after which a more
complete examination would be carried out and we didn't have time to examine
for other wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was such a more complete examination ever carried out by the
doctors in Parkland?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir; not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As we said initially this was an acute emergency situation
and there was not time initially and when the cardiac massage was done this
prevented any further examination during this time this was being done. After
the President was pronounced dead his wife was there, he was the President,
and we felt certainly that complete examination would be carried out and no
one had the heart, I believe, to examine him then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe, as specifically as you can then, the neck wounds
which you heretofore mentioned briefly?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. There was a small wound, 5- to 8-mm. in size, located in the
lower third of the neck, below the thyroid cartilage, the Adams apple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Will you show us about where it was?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Just about where your tie would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where did it enter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. It entered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At the time we did not <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. The entrance. All we knew this was a small wound here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see. And you put your hand right above where your tie is?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir; just where the <span class="locked">tie&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. A little bit to the left.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. To the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes; to the right.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes. And this wound was fairly round, had no jagged edges,
no evidence of powder burns, and so forth.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No evidence of powder burns?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. So far as I know.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In the front?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described that wound as specifically as you can
based upon your observations at the time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And your recollection at the time of those observations?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes; an even round wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You felt this wound in the neck was not a fatal wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is, absent the head wound, would the President have survived
the wound which was present on his neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I think very likely he would have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based on your observations on the neck wound alone did you
have a sufficient basis to form an opinion as to whether it was an entrance or
an exit wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir; we did not. Not having completely evaluated all the
wounds, traced out the course of the bullets, this wound would have been compatible
with either entrance or exit wound depending upon the size, the velocity,
the tissue structure and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Permit me to add some facts which I shall ask you to assume
as being true for purposes of having you express an opinion.</p>

<p>First of all, assume that the President was struck by a 6.5 mm. copper-jacketed
bullet from a rifle having a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,000
feet per second at a time when the President was approximately 160 to 250
feet from the weapon, with the President being struck from the rear at a
downward angle of approximately 45 degrees, being struck on the upper right
posterior thorax just above the upper border of the scapula 14 centimeters from
the tip of the right acromion process and 14 centimeters below the tip of the right
mastoid process.</p>

<p>Assume further that the missile passed through the body of the President
striking no bones, traversing the neck and sliding between the large muscles in
the posterior aspect of the President's body through a fascia channel without
violating the pleural cavity, but bruising only the apex of the right pleural
cavity and bruising the most apical portion of the right lung, then causing a
hematoma to the right of the larynx which you have described, and creating
a jagged wound in the trachea, then exiting precisely at the point where you
observe the puncture wound to exist.</p>

<p>Now based on those facts was the appearance of the wound in your opinion
consistent with being an exit wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. It certainly was. It could have been under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And assuming that all the facts which I have given you to be
true, do you have an opinion with a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to
whether, in fact, the wound was an entrance wound or an exit wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. With those facts and the fact as I understand it no other
bullet was found this would be, this was, I believe, was an exit wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were any bullets found in the President's body by the doctors
at Parkland?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the President's clothing ever examined by you, Dr. Carrico?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the reason for no examination of the clothing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Again in the emergency situation the nurses removed the clothing
after we had initially unbuttoned enough to get a look at him, at his chest, and
as the routine is set up, the nurses remove the clothing and we just don't take
time to look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the President's body then ever turned over at any point by
you or any of the other doctors at Parkland?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was President Kennedy lying on the emergency stretcher from
the time he was brought into trauma room one until the treatment at Parkland
Hospital was concluded?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time was that treatment concluded, to the best of your
recollection?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At about 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time did you leave the trauma room
where the President was brought?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I left right at one when we decided that he was dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did the other doctors leave at the same time or did any
remain in the trauma room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I left before some of the other doctors, I do not remember specifically
who was there. I believe Dr. Baxter was, Dr. Jenkins was still there,
I believe. And I think Dr. Perry was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have described a number of doctors in the course of your
testimony up to this point. Would you state what other doctors were present
during the time the President was treated, to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Well, I have already mentioned Dr. Don Curtis, the surgery
resident; Martin White, an interne; Dr. Perry was there, Dr. Baxter, Dr. McClelland,
a member of the surgery staff; Dr. Ronald Jones, chief surgery resident;
Dr. Jenkins, chief of anesthesia; several other physicians whose names I
can't remember at the present. Admiral Burkley, I believe was his name, the
President's physician, was there as soon as he got to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your view, Dr. Carrico, as to how many bullets struck
the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At the time of the initial examination I really had no view.
In view of what we have been told by you, and the Commission, two bullets
would be my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based on the additional facts which I have asked you to
<span class="locked">assume&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And also based on the autopsy report from <span class="locked">Bethesda&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which was made available to you by me.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, who, if any one, has talked to you representing the Federal
Government in connection with the treatment which you assisted in rendering
President Kennedy at Parkland on November 22?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. We have talked to some representatives of the Secret Service,
whose names I do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On how many occasions, if there was more than one?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Two occasions, a fairly long interview shortly after the President's
death, and then approximately a month or so afterwards a very short
interview.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you say shortly after the President's death, you
mean that day?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir. Within a week maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the substance of the first interview with the
Secret Service which you have described as occurring within 1 week?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This was a meeting in Dr. Shires' office, Dr. Shires, Dr. Perry,
Dr. McClelland and myself, and two representatives of the Secret Service in
which we went over the treatment.</p>

<p>They discussed the autopsy findings as I recall it, with Dr. Shires, and reviewed
the treatment with him, essentially.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what questions were you asked specifically at that time, if
any?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I don't recall any specific questions I was asked. In general,
I was asked some questions pertaining to his treatment, to the wounds, what I
thought they were, and et cetera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What opinions did you express at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Again, I said that on the basis of our initial examination, this
wound in his neck could have been either an entrance or exit wound, which was
what they were most concerned about, and assuming there was a wound in the
back, somewhere similar to what you have described that this certainly would
be compatible with an exit wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were your statements at that time different in any respect with
the testimony which you have given here this morning?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were your views at that time consistent with the findings in
the autopsy report, or did they vary in any way from the findings in that
report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As I recall, the autopsy report is exactly as I remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were your opinions at that time consistent with the findings
of the autopsy report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you identify Dr. Shires for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Dr. Shires is chief of the surgery service at Parkland, and
chairman of the Department of Surgery at Southwestern Medical School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, approximately when, to the best of your recollection, did
the second interview occur with the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This was some time in February, probably about the middle
of February, and the interview consisted of the agent asking me if I had any
further information.</p>

<p>I said I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that the total context of the interview?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did I interview you and take your deposition in Dallas,
Tex., last Wednesday?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And has that deposition transcript been made available to you
this morning?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. It has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were the views you expressed to me in our conversation
before the deposition and on the record during the course of the deposition
different in any way with the testimony which you have provided here this
morning?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir; they were not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Carrico, have you changed your opinion in any way concerning
your observations or conclusions about the situation with respect to
President Kennedy at any time since November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any notes or writings of any sort in your possession
concerning your participation in the treatment of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. None other than the letter to my children I mentioned to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state briefly the general nature of that for the Commission
here today, please.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This is just a letter written to my children to be read by them
later, saying what happened, how I felt about it. And maybe why it happened,
and maybe it would do them some good later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you also make a written report which was made a part of the
records of Parkland Hospital which you have identified for the record during
the deposition proceeding?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do those constitute the total of the writings which you made
concerning your participation in the treatment of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You spoke of a letter to your children. I don't want to invade
your privacy in this respect in any way, but is there anything in that letter that
you think would bear on our considerations here by this Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No; I don't believe so. This thing doesn't mention the treatment
other than to say probably by the time they read the letter it will be
archaic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You spoke about the causes of it all, I don't know <span class="locked">whether&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Just a little homespun philosophy. I just said that there was
a lot of extremism both in Dallas and in the Nation as a whole, and in an
attitude of extremism a warped mind can flourish much better than in a more
stable atmosphere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Carrico, was the nature of the treatment affected, in
your opinion, in any way by the fact that you were working on the President
of the United States?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I don't believe so, sir. We have seen a large number of acutely
injured people, and acutely ill people, and the treatment has been carried out
enough that this is almost reflex, if you will. Certainly everyone was emotionally
affected. I think, if anything, the emotional aspect made us think faster,
work faster and better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think would be helpful
to the Commission in its inquiry on the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Those conclude my questions, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Dulles, have you any questions to ask of the Doctor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Looking back on it, do you think it was probable that death
followed almost immediately after this shot in the head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir; as I <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I was absent, I am sorry, at that time.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir. Medically, I suppose you would have to say he was
alive when he came to Parkland. From a practical standpoint, I think he was
dead then.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did you say that he arrived, when you first started
working on the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. It would only be a guess. Probably about 12:35. It was about
12:30 when I got in the emergency room, and I was there 2 or 3 minutes
when we were called, and he was there within 2 or 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. So approximately from 12:35 until 1 the President was
examined and treatment was given by you and others?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you read and analyzed the autopsy performed by
the authorities at Bethesda?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I have not read it carefully. I have seen it. Mr. Specter
showed me parts of it, and I had seen a copy of it earlier, briefly.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is there anything in it that you have read that would
be in conflict with your observation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Nothing at all in conflict. It certainly adds to the observations
that we made.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Have you been interviewed by the press and, if so,
when?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I think I have talked to the press twice.</p>

<p>Mr. Burrus, a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald, talked to me about 5
minutes, probably 3 or 4 days after the President's death, and then a reporter
from Time called about 3 or 4 weeks after the President's death, and I talked
to him for a very few minutes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you make any statements in either of these interviews
that are different from the observations you have made here this morning?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, could I&mdash;off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Doctor, thank you very much. We appreciate your
help.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Certainly. Glad to be here.</p>

<h2 id="mp">TESTIMONY OF DR. MALCOLM PERRY</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Dr. Perry, will you be sworn now, please?</p>

<p>Would you raise your right hand and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before the Commission
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help
you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Will you be seated, please?</p>

<p>Mr. Specter will conduct the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Malcolm Oliver Perry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your residence address?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. 4115 Parkland, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Your professional address?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. 5323 Harley Hines Boulevard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the address of Parkland Memorial Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That is the address of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that situated immediately adjacent to Parkland Memorial
Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your age, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. 34.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I am a physician and surgeon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you duly licensed to practice medicine by the State of
Texas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly your educational background, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. After graduation from Plano High School in 1947, I attended
the University of Texas and was duly graduated there in January of 1951 with
a degree of Bachelor of Arts.</p>

<p>I subsequently graduated from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
School in 1956 with a degree of Doctor of Medicine. I served an internship
of 12 months at Letterman Hospital in San Francisco, and after 2 more years
in the Air Force I returned to Parkland for a 4-year residency in general
surgery.</p>

<p>I completed that <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where did you serve in the Air Force, by the way?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I was in Spokane, Wash., Geiger Field.</p>

<p>At the completion of my surgery residency in June of 1962, I was appointed
an instructor in surgery at the Southwestern Medical School.</p>

<p>But in September 1962, I returned to the University of California at San
Francisco to spend a year in vascular surgery. During that time, I took and
passed my boards for the certification for the American Board of Surgery.</p>

<p>I returned to Parkland Hospital and Southwestern in September of 1963, was
appointed an assistant professor of surgery, attending surgeon and vascular
consultant for Parkland Hospital and John Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What experience have you had, Dr. Perry, if any, in gunshot
wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. During my period in medical school and my residency, I have
seen a large number, from 150 to 200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your duties at Parkland Memorial Hospital, if any,
on November 22d, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. On that day I had come over from the medical school for the
usual 1 o'clock rounds with the residents, and Dr. Ronald Jones and I, he being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
chief surgical resident, were having dinner in the main dining room there in
the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe how you happened to be called in to render
assistance to President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Somewhere around 12:30, and I cannot give you the time accurately
since I did not look at my watch in that particular instant, an emergency
page was put in for Dr. Tom Shires, who is chief of the emergency surgical
service in Parkland. I knew he was in Galveston attending a meeting and giving
a paper, and I asked Dr. Jones to pick up the page to see if he or I could be of
assistance.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Doctor, at this time I must leave for a session at the Supreme
Court, and the hearing will continue. Congressman Ford, I am going to
ask you if you will preside in my absence. If you are obliged to go to the
Congress, Commissioner Dulles will preside, and I will be available as soon as the
Court session is over to be here with you.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Warren withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Will you proceed, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action did you take after learning of the emergency call,
Dr. Perry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The emergency room is one flight of stairs down from the main
dining cafeteria, so Dr. Jones and I went immediately to the emergency room
to render what assistance we could.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask this: In the confirmation of the page call,
was it told to you that the President was the patient involved?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It was told to Dr. Jones, who picked up the page, that President
Kennedy had been shot and was being brought to Parkland. We went down
immediately to the emergency room to await his arrival. However, he was
there when we reached it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who else was present at the time you arrived on the scene with
the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. When Dr. Jones and I entered the emergency room, the place
was filled with people, most of them officers and, apparently, attendants to the
Presidential procession. Dr. Carrico was in attendance with the President
in trauma room No. 1 when I walked in. There were several other people
there. Mrs. Kennedy was there with some gentleman whom I didn't know.
I have the impression there was another physician in the room, but I cannot
recall at this time who it was. There were several nurses there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were any other doctors present besides Dr. Carrico?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I think there was another doctor present, but I don't know who
it was, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Can I ask a question here, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is the procedure for somebody taking command in a situation
of this kind? Who takes over and who says who should do what? I
realize it is an emergency situation. Maybe that is an improper question.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But it would be very helpful to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; it is perfectly proper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In reviewing the situation to see how you acted.</p>

<p>In a military situation, you have somebody who takes command.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. We do, too. And it essentially is based on the same kind of thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I would like to hear about that.</p>

<p>If it doesn't fit in <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It is fine.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It is based on rank and experience, essentially. For example, Dr.
Carrico being the senior surgical resident in the area, at the time President
Kennedy was brought in to the emergency suite, would have done what we
felt was necessary and would have assumed control of the situation being as
there were interns and probably medical students around the area, but being
senior would take it. This, of course, catapulted me into this because I was
the senior attending staff man when I arrived and at that time Dr. Carrico
has noted I took over direction of the care since I was senior of all the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
there and being as we are surgeons, the department of surgery operates that
portion of the emergency room and directs the care of the patients.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you try to clear the room of unnecessary people?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. This was done, not by me, but by the nurse supervisor, I assume,
but several of the people were asked to leave the room. Generally, this
is not necessary. In an instance such as this, it is a little more difficult, as you
can understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. But this care of an acutely injured and acutely injured patients
goes on quite rapidly. Over 90,000 a year go through that emergency room, and,
as a result, people are well trained in the performance of their duties. There
is generally no problem in asking anyone to leave the room because everyone
is quite busy and they know what they have to do and are proceeding to
do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Upon your arrival in the room, where President Kennedy was
situated, what did you observe as to his condition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. At the time I entered the door, Dr. Carrico was attending him.
He was attaching the Bennett apparatus to an endotracheal tube in place to
assist his respiration.</p>

<p>The President was lying supine on the carriage, underneath the overhead
lamp. His shirt, coat, had been removed. There was a sheet over his lower
extremities and the lower portion of his trunk. He was unresponsive. There
was no evidence of voluntary motion. His eyes were open, deviated up and outward,
and the pupils were dilated and fixed.</p>

<p>I did not detect a heart beat and was told there was no blood pressure
obtainable.</p>

<p>He was, however, having ineffective spasmodic respiratory efforts.</p>

<p>There was blood on the carriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What does that mean to the amateur, to the unprofessional?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Short, rather jerky contractions of his chest and diaphragm,
pulling for air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were those respiratory efforts on his part alone or was he being
aided in his breathing at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He had just attached the machine and at this point it was not
turned on. He was attempting to breathe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that those efforts were being made at that juncture at least
without mechanical aid?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Those were spontaneous efforts on the part of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you continue, then, Dr. Perry, as to what you observed
of his condition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, there was blood noted on the carriage and a large avulsive
wound on the right posterior cranium.</p>

<p>I cannot state the size, I did not examine it at all. I just noted the presence
of lacerated brain tissue. In the lower part of the neck below the Adams apple
was a small, roughly circular wound of perhaps 5 mm. in diameter from which
blood was exuding slowly.</p>

<p>I did not see any other wounds.</p>

<p>I examined the chest briefly, and from the anterior portion did not see anything.</p>

<p>I pushed up the brace on the left side very briefly to feel for his femoral pulse,
but did not obtain any.</p>

<p>I did no further examination because it was obvious that if any treatment were
to be carried out with any success a secure effective airway must be obtained
immediately.</p>

<p>I asked Dr. Carrico if the wound on the neck was actually a wound or
had he begun a tracheotomy and he replied in the negative, that it was a wound,
and at that <span class="locked">point&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am a little confused, I thought Dr. Carrico was absent. That
was an earlier period.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; he was present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He was present?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes; he was present when I walked in the room and, at that
point, I asked someone to secure a tracheotomy tray but there was one already
there. Apparently Dr. Carrico had already asked them to set up the tray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, backtracking just a bit from the context of the
answer which you have just given, would you describe the quantity of blood
which you observed on the carriage when you first came into the room where the
President was located?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Mr. Specter, this is an extremely difficult thing. The estimation
of blood when it is either on the floor or on drapes or bandages is grossly
inaccurate in almost every instance.</p>

<p>As you know, many hospitals have studied this extensively to try to determine
whether they were able to do it with any accuracy but they cannot. I can just
tell you there was considerable blood present on the carriage and some on his
head and some on the floor but how much, I would hesitate to estimate. Several
hundred CC's would be the closest I could get but it could be from 200 to
1,500 and I know by experience you cannot estimate it more accurately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you characterize it as a very substantial or minor blood
loss?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. A substantial blood loss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you mentioned the President's brace. Could you describe
that as specifically as possible?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I did not examine it. I noted its presence only in an
effort to reach the femoral pulse and I pushed it up just slightly so that I
might palpate for the femoral pulse, I did no more examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In the course of seeking the femoral pulse, did you observe or
note an Ace bandage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In the brace area?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir. It was my impression, I saw a portion of an Ace
Bandage, an elastic supporting bandage on the right thigh. I did not examine
it at all but I just noted its presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the Ace Bandage cover any portion of the President's body
that you were able to observe in addition to the right thigh?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I did not go any further. I just noted its presence
right there at the junction at the hip. It could have been on the lower trunk
or the upper thigh, I don't know. I didn't care any further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you continue to describe the resuscitative efforts that
were undertaken at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. At the beginning I had removed my coat and watch as I entered
the room and dropped it off in the corner, and as I was talking to Dr. Carrico
in regard to the neck wound, I glanced cursorily at the head wound and noted
its severe character, and then proceeded with the tracheotomy after donning
a pair of gloves. I asked that someone call Dr. Kemp Clark, of neurosurgery,
Dr. Robert McClelland, Dr. Charles Baxter, assistant professors of surgery, to
come and assist. There were several other people in the room by this time,
none of which I can identify. I then began the tracheotomy making a transverse
incision right through the wound in the neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you elect to make the tracheotomy incision through
the wound in the neck, Dr. Perry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The area of the wound, as pointed out to you in the lower third
of the neck anteriorly is customarily the spot one would electively perform the
tracheotomy.</p>

<p>This is one of the safest and easiest spots to reach the trachea. In addition
the presence of the wound indicated to me there was possibly an underlaying
wound to the neck muscles in the neck, the carotid artery or the jugular
vein. If you are going to control these it is necessary that the incision be as
low, that is toward the heart or lungs as the wound if you are going to obtain
adequate control.</p>

<p>Therefore, for expediency's sake I went directly to that level to obtain control
of the airway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe, in a general way and in lay terms, the
purpose for the tracheotomy at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Carrico had very judicially placed an endotracheal tube
but unfortunately due to the injury to the trachea, the cuff which is an inflatable
balloon on the endotracheal tube was not below the tracheal injury
and thus he could not secure the adequate airway that you would require to
maintain respiration.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. McCloy entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, you mentioned an injury to the trachea.</p>

<p>Will you describe that as precisely as you can, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes. Once the transverse incision through the skin and subcutaneous
tissues was made, it was necessary to separate the strap muscles
covering the anterior muscles of the windpipe and thyroid. At that point the
trachea was noted to be deviated slightly to the left and I found it necessary
to sever the exterior strap muscles on the other side to reach the trachea.</p>

<p>I noticed a small ragged laceration of the trachea on the anterior lateral
right side. I could see the endotracheal tube which had been placed by Dr.
Carrico in the wound, but there was evidence of air and blood around the
tube because I noted the cuff was just above the injury to the trachea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you now proceed to describe what efforts you made to save
the President's life?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. At this point, I had entered the neck, and Dr. Baxter and
Dr. McClelland arrived shortly thereafter. I cannot describe with accuracy
their exact arrival. I only know I looked up and saw Dr. Baxter as I began the
tracheotomy and he took a pair of gloves to assist me.</p>

<p>Dr. McClelland's presence was known to me at the time he picked up an
instrument and said, "Here, I will hand it to you."</p>

<p>At that point I was down in the trachea. Once the trachea had been exposed
I took the knife and incised the windpipe at the point of the bullet
injury. And asked that the endotracheal tube previously placed by Dr. Carrico
be withdrawn slightly so I could insert a tracheotomy tube at this level.
This was effected and attached to an anesthesia machine which had been
brought down by Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Giesecke for better control of circulation.</p>

<p>I noticed there was free air and blood in the right mediastinum and although
I could not see any evidence, myself any evidence, of it in the pleura of the
lung the presence of this blood in this area could be indicative of the underlying
condition.</p>

<p>I asked someone to put in a chest tube to allow sealed drainage of any blood
or air which might be accumulated in the right hemothorax.</p>

<p>This occurred while I was doing the tracheotomy. I did not know at the
time when I inserted the tube but I was informed subsequently that Dr. Paul
Peters, assistant professor of urology, and Dr. Charles Baxter, previously
noted in this record, inserted the chest tube and attached it to underwater
seal or drainage of the right pneumothorax.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How long did this tracheotomy take, approximately?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I don't know that for sure, Mr. Dulles. However, I have&mdash;a
matter of 3 to 5 minutes, perhaps even less. This was very&mdash;I didn't look at
the watch, I have done them at those speeds and faster when I have had to.
So I would estimate that.</p>

<p>At this point also Dr. Carrico, having previously attached and assisting
with the attaching of the anesthesia machine was doing another cut down on
the right leg; Dr. Ronald Jones was doing an additional cut down, venous
section on the left arm for the insertion of plastic cannula into veins so one may
rapidly and effectively infuse blood and fluids. These were being done.</p>

<p>It is to Dr. Carrico's credit, I think he ordered the hydrocortisone for the
President having known he suffered from adrenal insufficiency and in this
particular instance being quite busy he had the presence of mind to recall
this and order what could have been a lifesaving measure, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you identify who Dr. Baxter is?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes. Dr. Charles Baxter is, when I noted when I asked for the
call, is an assistant professor of surgery also and Dr. McClelland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is Dr. McClelland occupying a similar position at Parkland
Memorial Hospital as Dr. Baxter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you identify Dr. Jenkins?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins is professor and chairman of the department
of anesthesiology and chief of the anesthesia service, and Dr. Giesecke is assistant
professor of anesthesiology at Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now identified all of the medical personnel whom
you can recollect who were present at the time the aid was being rendered to
the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; several other people entered the room. I recall seeing
Dr. Bashour who is an associate professor of medicine and chief of the cardiology
section at Parkland.</p>

<p>Dr. Don W. Seldin, who is professor and chairman of the department of
medicine, and I previously mentioned Dr. Paul Peters, assistant professor
of urology, and I believe that Dr. Jackie Hunt of the department of anesthesiology
was also there, and there were other people, I cannot identify them,
several nurses and several others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. William Kemp Clark arrived at about that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Clark's arrival was first noted to me after the completion of
the tracheotomy, and at this point, the cardiotachyscope had been attached
to Mr. Kennedy to detect any electrical activity and although I did not note
any, being occupied, it was related to me there was initially evidence of a
spontaneous electrical activity in the President's heart.</p>

<p>However, at the completion of the tracheotomy and the institution of the
sealed tube drainage of the chest, Dr. Clark and I began external cardiac
massage. This was monitored by Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Giesecke who informed
us we were obtaining a satisfactory carotid pulse in the neck, and someone
whose name I do not know at this time, said they could also feel a femoral
pulse in the leg. We continued external cardiac massage, I continued it as
Dr. Clark examined the head wound and observed the cardiotachyscope. The
exact time interval that this took I cannot tell you. I continued it until Dr.
Jenkins and Dr. Clark informed me there was no activity at all, in the cardiotachyscope
and that there had been no neurological or muscular response to our
resuscitative effort at all and that the wound which the President sustained of
his head was a mortal wound, and at that point we determined that he had
expired and we abandoned efforts of resuscitation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you identify Dr. Clark's specialty for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Clark is professor and chairman of the department of neurosurgery
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, and chief of
the neurosurgical services at Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you described a condition in the right mediastinum.
Would you elaborate on what your views were of the condition at the time
you were rendering this treatment?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The condition of this area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There was both blood, free blood and air in the right superior
mediastinum. That is the space that is located between the lungs and the
heart at that level.</p>

<p>As I noted, I did not see any underlying injury of the pleura, the coverings
of the lungs or of the lungs themselves. But in the presence of this large amount
of blood in this area, one would be unable to detect small injuries to the underlying
structures. The air was indicated by the fact that there was some
frothing of this blood present, bubbling which could have been due to the
tracheal injury or an underlying injury to the lung.</p>

<p>Since the morbidity attendant upon insertion of an anterior chest tube
for sealed drainage is negligible and the morbidity which attends a pneumothorax
is considerable, I elected to have the chest tube put in place because we
were giving him positive pressure oxygen and the possibility of inducing a
tension on pneumothorax would be quite high in such instances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is pneumothorax?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Hemothorax would be blood in the free chest cavity and pneumothorax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
would be air in the free chest cavity underlying collapse of the lungs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that have been caused by the injury which you noted to
the President's trachea?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There was no evidence of a hemothorax or a pneumothorax through
my examination; only it is sufficient this could have been observed because of
the free blood in the mediastinum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were the symptoms which excited your suspicion causable by
the injury to the trachea?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. They were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time was the pronouncement of death made?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Approximately 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By whom was death announced?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Kemp Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any special reason why it was Dr. Kemp Clark who
pronounced the President had died?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It was the opinion of those of us who had attended the President
that the ultimate cause of his demise was a severe injury to his brain
with subsequent loss of neurologic function and subsequent massive loss of
blood, and thus Dr. Clark, being a neurosurgeon, signed the death certificate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In your opinion, would the President have survived the injury
which he sustained to the neck which you have described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Barring the advent of complications this wound was tolerable, and
I think he would have survived it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described all of the treatment which was
rendered to the President by the medical team in attendance at Parkland
Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. In essence I have, Mr. Specter. I do not know the exact quantities
of balance salt solutions or blood that was given. I mentioned the 300
mg. of hydrocortisone Dr. Carrico ordered and, of course, he was given oxygen
under pressure which has been previously recorded. The quantities of substances
or any other drugs I have no knowledge of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In general you have recounted the treatment?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now stated for the record all of the individuals who
were in attendance in treating the President that you can recollect at this time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you now describe as specifically as you can, the injury
which you noted in the President's head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. As I mentioned previously in the record, I made only a cursory
examination of the President's head. I noted a large avulsive wound of the
right parietal occipital area, in which both scalp and portions of skull were
absent, and there was severe laceration of underlying brain tissue. My examination
did not go any further than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you, to be specific, observe a smaller wound below the
large avulsed area which you have described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there blood in that area of the President's head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which might have obscured such a wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There was a considerable amount of blood at the head of the
cartilage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you now describe as particularly as possible the neck
wound you observed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. This was situated in the lower anterior one-third of the neck,
approximately 5 mm. in diameter.</p>

<p>It was exuding blood slowly which partially obscured it. Its edges were
neither ragged nor were they punched out, but rather clean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described the neck wound as specifically as you
can?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based on your observations of the neck wound alone, do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
have a sufficient basis to form an opinion as to whether it was an entrance
wound or an exit wound,</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir. I was unable to determine that since I did not ascertain
the exact trajectory of the missile. The operative procedure which I performed
was restricted to securing an adequate airway and insuring there was
no injury to the carotid artery or jugular vein at that level and at that point I
made the procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based on the appearance of the neck wound alone, could it
have been either an entrance or an exit wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It could have been either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Permit me to supply some additional facts, Dr. Perry, which
I shall ask you to assume as being true for purposes of having you express an
opinion.</p>

<p>Assume first of all that the President was struck by a 6.5-mm. copper-jacketed
bullet fired from a gun having a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,000 feet
per second, with the weapon being approximately 160 to 250 feet from the
President, with the bullet striking him at an angle of declination of approximately
45 degrees, striking the President on the upper right posterior thorax
just above the upper border of the scapula, being 14 cm. from the tip of the
right acromion process and 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid process,
passing through the President's body striking no bones, traversing the neck
and sliding between the large muscles in the posterior portion of the President's
body through a fascia channel without violating the pleural cavity but bruising
the apex of the right pleural cavity, and bruising the most apical portion of
the right lung inflicting a hematoma to the right side of the larynx, which you
have just described, and striking the trachea causing the injury which you
described, and then exiting from the hole that you have described in the midline
of the neck.</p>

<p>Now, assuming those facts to be true, would the hole which you observed
in the neck of the President be consistent with an exit wound under those
circumstances?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Certainly would be consistent with an exit wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, assuming one additional fact that there was no bullet
found in the body of the President, and assuming the facts which I have just
set forth to be true, do you have an opinion as to whether the wound which
you observed in the President's neck was an entrance or an exit wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. A full jacketed bullet without deformation passing through
skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and entrance wound and with
the facts which you have made available and with these assumptions, I believe
that it was an exit wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have sufficient facts available to you to render an
opinion as to the cause of the injury which you observed in the President's
head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had an opportunity to examine the autopsy report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are the facts set forth in the autopsy report consistent
with your observations and views or are they inconsistent in any way with
your findings and opinions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. They are quite consistent and I noted initially that they explained
very nicely the circumstances as we observed them at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you elaborate on that last answer, Dr. Perry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes. There was some considerable speculation, as you will recall,
as to whether there were one or two bullets and as to from whence they came.
Dr. Clark and I were queried extensively in respect to this and in addition
Dr. Carrico could not determine whether there were one or two bullets from
our initial examination.</p>

<p>I say that because we did what was necessary in the emergency procedure, and
abandoned any efforts of examination at the termination. I did not ascertain
the trajectory of any of the missiles. As a result I did not know whether
there was evidence for 1 or 2 or even 3 bullets entering and at the particular
time it was of no importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But based on the additional factors provided in the autopsy
report, do you have an opinion at this time as to the number of bullets there
were?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The wounds as described from the autopsy report and coupled with
the wounds I have observed it would appear there were two missiles that struck
the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And based on the additional factors which I have provided
to you by way of hypothetical assumption, and the factors present in the autopsy
report from your examination of that report, what does the source of the bullets
seem to have been to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That I could not say. I can only determine their pathway, on
the basis of these reports within the President's body.</p>

<p>As to their ultimate source not knowing any of the circumstances surrounding
it, I would not have any speculation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From what direction would the bullets have come based on all
of those factors?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The bullets would have come from behind the President based on
these factors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And from the level, from below or above the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Not having examined any of the wounds with the exception of
the anterior neck wounds, I could not say. This wound, as I noted was about
5 mm., and roughly circular in shape. There is no way for me to determine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based upon a point of entrance in the body of the President
which I described to you as being 14 cm. from the right acromion process
and 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid process and coupling that
with your observation of the neck wound, would that provide a sufficient basis
for you to form an opinion as to the path of the bullet, as to whether it was
level, up or down?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, it would.</p>

<p>In view of the fact there was an injury to the right lateral portion of the
trachea and a wound in the neck if one were to extend a line roughly between
these two, it would be going slightly superiorly, that is cephalad toward the
head, from anterior to posterior, which would indicate that the missile entered
from slightly above and behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, have you been a part of or participated in any
press conferences?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; I have</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And by whom, if anyone, were the press conferences arranged?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The initial press conference, to the best of my knowledge, was
arranged by Mr. Hawkes who was identified to me as being of the White House
Press, and Mr. Steve Landregan of the hospital administration there at Parkland,
and Dr. Kemp Clark.</p>

<p>They called me, I was in the operating suite at the time to assist with the
care of the Governor, and they called and asked me if it would be possible for
me to come down to a press conference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time did that call come to you, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I am not real sure about that but probably around 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action, if any, did you take in response to that call?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I put in a page for Dr. Baxter and Dr. McClelland since they were
also involved, and went down to the emergency room where I met Mr. Hawkes
and Dr. Clark. And from there we went up to classrooms one and two which
had been combined into a large press room, and was packed with gentlemen
and ladies of the press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what building was that located?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. This was in Parkland Hospital, in the classroom section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to identify which news media were present at that
time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; there were numerous people in the room. I would estimate
maybe a hundred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What doctors spoke at that press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Clark and I answered the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who spoke first as between you and Dr. Clark?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state as specifically as you can the questions which
were asked of you at that time and the answers which you gave?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Mr. Specter, I would preface this by saying that, as you know,
I have been interviewed on numerous occasions subsequent to that time, and
I cannot recall with accuracy the questions that were asked. They, in general,
were similar to the questions that were asked here. The press were given
essentially the same, but in no detail such as have been given here. I was
asked, for example, what I felt caused the President's death, the nature of
the wound, from whence they came, what measures were taken for resuscitation,
who were the people in attendance, at what time was it determined that he
was beyond our help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What responses did you give to questions relating to the source
of the bullets, if such questions were asked?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I could not. I pointed out that both Dr. Clark and I had no
way of knowing from whence the bullets came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you asked how many bullets there were?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. We were, and our reply was it was impossible with the knowledge
we had at hand to ascertain if there were 1 or 2 bullets, or more. We were
given, similarly, to the discussion here today, hypothetical situations. "Is it
possible that such could have been the case, or such and such?" If it was possible
that there was one bullet. To this, I replied in the affirmative, it was
possible and conceivable that it was only one bullet, but I did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would the trajectory, or conceivable course of one bullet
have been, Dr. Perry, to account for the injuries which you observed in the
President, as you stated it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Since I observed only two wounds in my cursory examination,
it would have necessitated the missile striking probably a bony structure and
being deviated in its course in order to account for these two wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What bony structure was it conceivably?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It required striking the spine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you express a professional opinion that that did, in fact,
happen or it was a matter of speculation that it could have happened?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I expressed it as a matter of speculation that this was conceivable.
But, again, Dr. Clark and I emphasized that we had no way of
knowing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now recounted as specifically as you can recollect what
occurred at that first press conference or is it practical for you to give any
further detail to the contents of that press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I do not recall any specific details any further than that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Specter&mdash;was there ever a recording kept of the
questions and answers at that interview, Dr. Perry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. This was one of the things I was mad about, Mr. Ford. There
were microphones, and cameras, and the whole bit, as you know, and during
the course of it a lot of these hypothetical situations and questions that were
asked to us would often be asked by someone on this side and recorded by some
one on this, and I don't know who was recorded and whether they were broadcasting
it directly. There were tape recorders there and there were television
cameras with their microphones. I know there were recordings made but who
made them I don't know and, of course, portions of it would be given to this
group and questions answered here and, as a result, considerable questions were
not answered in their entirety and even some of them that were asked, I am
sure were misunderstood. It was bedlam.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I was thinking, was there an official recording either
made by the hospital officials or by the White House people or by any government
agency?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. A true recording of everything that was said, the
questions asked, and the answers given?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was there any reasonably good account in any of the press of
this interview?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I <span class="locked">ask&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I have failed to see one that was asked.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In other words, you subsequently read or heard what
was allegedly said by you and by Dr. Clark and Dr. Carrico. Were those reportings
by the news media accurate or inaccurate as to what you and others
said?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. In general, they were inaccurate. There were some that were
fairly close, but I, as you will probably surmise, was pretty full after both
Friday and Sunday, and after the interviews again, following the operation of
which I was a member on Sunday, I left town, and I did not read a lot of them,
but of those which I saw I found none that portrayed it exactly as it happened.
Nor did I find any that reported our statements exactly as they were given.
They were frequently taken out of context. They were frequently mixed up
as to who said what or identification as to which person was who.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This interview took place on Sunday, the 24th, did you
say?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, there were several interviews, Mr. Ford. We had one in
the afternoon, Friday afternoon, and then I spent almost the entire day Saturday
in the administrative suite at the hospital answering questions to people
of the press, and some medical people of the American Medical Association.
And then, of course, Sunday, following the operation on Oswald, I again attended
the press conference since I was the first in attendance with him. And, subsequently,
there was another conference on Monday conducted by the American
Medical Association, and a couple of more interviews with some people whom
I don't even recall.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would you say that these errors that were reported
were because of a lack of technical knowledge as to what you as a physician
were saying, or others were saying?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Certainly that could be it in part, but it was not all. Certainly
a part of it was lack of attention. A question would be asked and you
would incompletely answer it and another question would be asked and they
had gotten what they wanted without really understanding, and they would go
on and it would go out of context. For example, on the speculation on the
ultimate source of bullets, I obviously knew less about it than most people
because I was in the hospital at the time and didn't know the circumstances
surrounding it until it was over. I was much too busy and yet I was quoted
as saying that the bullet, there was probably one bullet, which struck and deviated
upward which came from the front, and what I had replied was to a
question, was it conceivable that this could have happened, and I said yes, it is
conceivable.</p>

<p>I have subsequently learned that to use a straight affirmative word like
"yes" is not good relations; that one should say it is conceivable and not give
a straight yes or no answer.</p>

<p>"It is conceivable" was dropped and the "yes" was used, and this was happening
over and over again. Of course, Dr. Shires, for example, who was
the professor and chairman of the department was identified in one press release
as chief resident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As what? I didn't get it.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. As chief resident. And myself, as his being my superior, whereas
Dr. Ronald Jones was chief resident of course, nothing could be further from
the truth in identifying Dr. Shires as chief resident. I was identified as a resident
surgeon in the Dallas paper. And I am not impressed with the accuracy
of the press reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I don't know whether you have covered this very well. Let
me ask you about the wound, the wound that you examined in the President's
neck.</p>

<p>You said that it would have been tolerable. Would his speech have been
impaired?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I don't think so. The injury was below the larynx,
and certainly barring the advent of any complication would have healed without
any difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. He would have had a relatively normal life?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you, any other time, or other than the press conference
or any other period, say that you thought this was an exit wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When the President was brought, when you first saw the President,
was he fully clothed, or did you cut the clothing away?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Not at the time I saw him. Dr. Carrico and the nurses were all
in attendance, they had removed his coat and his shirt, which is standard procedure,
while we were proceeding about the examination, for them to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But you didn't actually remove his shirt?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you get the doctor's experience with regard to gunshot
wounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You said something to the effect that, of knowing the President
had an adrenalin insufficiency, is that something you could observe?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. This is common medical knowledge, sir, that he had had in
the past necessarily taken adrenalin steroids to support this insufficiency.
Dr. Carrico, at this moment of great stress, recalled this, and requested this
be given to him at that time, this is extremely important because people who
have adrenalin insufficiency are unable to mobilize this hormone at the time
of any great stress and it may be fatal without support from exogenous drugs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. In other words, you had a general medical history of the
President before he was&mdash;common knowledge.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No more so than anyone else, sir, except this would have stuck
with us, sir, since they were already in that line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you discuss with any of the other doctors present, and you
named quite a number of them, as to whether this was an exit wound or
an entrance wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; we did at the time. But our discussion was necessarily
limited by the fact that none of us knew, someone asked me now&mdash;you
must remember that actually the only people who saw this wound for sure
were Dr. Carrico and myself, and some of the other doctors were quoted as
saying something about the wound which actually they never said at all
because they never saw it, because on their arrival I had already made the
incision through the wound, and despite what the press releases may have
said neither Dr. Carrico nor myself could say whether it was an entrance
or an exit wound from the nature of the wound itself and Dr. McClelland was
quoted, for example, as saying he thought it was an exit wound, but that was
not what he said at all because he didn't even see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And it is a fact, is it not, that you did not see what we now
are supposed to believe was the entrance wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; we did not examine him. At that time, we attended
to the matters of expediency that were life-saving and the securing of an
adequate airway and the stanching of massive hemorrhage are really the
two medical emergencies; most everything else can wait, but those must be
attended to in a matter of minutes and consequently to termination of
treatment I had no morbid curiosity, my work was done, and actually I was
rather anxious to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I suggest, Mr. Specter, if you feel it is feasible, you send to
the doctor the accounts of his press conference or conferences.</p>

<p>And possibly, if you are willing, sir, you could send us a letter, send to the
Commission a letter, pointing out the various points in these press conferences
where you are inaccurately quoted, so we can have that as a matter of record.</p>

<p>Is that feasible?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That is, sir.</p>

<p>Would you prefer that each clipping be edited individually or a general
statement?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Well, I think it would be better to have each clipping dealt with
separately. Obviously, if you have answered one point in one clipping it won't
be necessary to answer that point if it is repeated in another clipping.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just deal with the new points.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I can and will do this.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This would be where Dr. Perry is quoted himself, or
Dr. Carrico, or anyone else, they would only pass judgment on the quotes
concerning themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That would be correct.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, because some of the other circumstances in some of the
press releases which have come to my attention have not been entirely accurate
either, regarding sequence of events, and although I would not have knowledge
about those you would not want those added necessarily, just any statement
alluded to have been made by me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think that would be better.</p>

<p>Don't you think so, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think it would be the proper procedure.</p>

<p>Is this a monumental job, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No, I think it is one which can be managed, Congressman Ford.
I might say we have done that with some of the clippings.</p>

<p>There was an article, as the deposition records will show when you have an
opportunity to review them, they have not been transcribed, as to an article
which appeared in La Expres, statements were attributed to Dr. <span class="locked">McClelland&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Which paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A French paper, La Expres. And I questioned the doctors
quoted therein and developed for the record what was true and what was false
on the statements attributed to them, so we have undertaken that in some
circles but not as extensively as you suggest as to Dr. Perry, because we have
been trying diligently to get the tape records of the television interviews, and
we were unsuccessful. I discussed this with Dr. Perry in Dallas last Wednesday,
and he expressed an interest in seeing them, and I told him we would make them
available to him prior to his appearance, before deposition or before the Commission,
except our efforts at CBS and NBC, ABC and everywhere including
New York, Dallas and other cities were to no avail.</p>

<p>The problem is they have not yet cataloged all of the footage which they
have, and I have been advised by the Secret Service, by Agent John Howlett,
that they have an excess of 200 hours of transcripts among all of the events and
they just have not cataloged them and could not make them available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you intend to catalog them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, they do, Mr. Dulles. They intend to do that eventually in
their normal process, and the Secret Service is trying to expedite the news
media to give us those, and it was our thought as to the film clips, which would
be the most direct or the recordings which would be the most direct, to make
comparisons between the reports in the news media and what Dr. Perry said
at that time, and the facts which we have from the doctors through our depositions
and transcript today.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you give us any time estimate when this catalog
and comparison might be made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Only that they are working on it right now, have been for some
time, but it may be a matter of a couple of weeks until they can turn it over.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Mr. Chairman, I have some doubt as to the present propriety of
making, of having the doctor make, comments in respect to a particular group
of newspaper articles. There have been comments, as we all know, around the
world, of great variety and great extent, and it would be practically impossible,
I suppose, to check all of the accounts and in failing to check one would not
wish to have it suggested that others, the accuracy of others was being endorsed.</p>

<p>I would suggest that the staff make an examination of the files that we have
of the comments, together with such tape recordings as may have been taken of
the actual press conferences, and after that examination is made we can then
determine, perhaps a little more effectively, what might be done to clarify this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
situation so that it would conform to the actual statements that the doctor
has made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Well, Mr. McCloy, it is quite satisfactory with me and I agree with
you we cannot run down all of the rumors in all of the press and it is quite
satisfactory with me to wait and see whether we have adequate information to
deal with this situation when we get in the complete tapes of the various television,
radio and other appearances, so that we have a pretty complete record
of what these two witnesses and others have said on the points we have been
discussing here today.</p>

<p>So I quite agree we will await this presentation to the doctors until we have
had a further chance to review this situation.</p>

<p>What I wanted to be sure was that when we are through with this we do have
in our files and records adequate information to deal with a great many of the
false rumors that have been spread on the basis of false interpretation of these
appearances before television, radio, and so forth and so on.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is that all, Mr. Dulles, and Mr. McCloy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask at this point, did you examine Governor Connally,
too?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I was in the operating room briefly to see about his leg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You haven't come to that point in your interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I understood you to say you did examine Oswald.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; I operated on Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described in general the press conferences in
which you participated immediately after the treatment which you rendered
to President Kennedy and following the treatment which you assisted in rendering
to Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. To the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you make an effort to leave the area of Dallas immediately
following the Monday after the weekend of the assassination and the
killing of Oswald in an effort to get away from the press conferences?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I left Monday afternoon approximately 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I went to McAllen, Tex., to the home of my mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how far is that from Dallas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. About 560 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you leave instructions as to revealing the destination that
you set upon?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, only with Dr. Shires and my secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you contacted by the press in McAllen?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The following day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were your whereabouts given either by Dr. Shires or your
secretary?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you relate briefly the sequence that followed in McAllen,
Tex.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The gentleman from UPI came out and knocked on the door,
and I was quite surprised, not having told anyone where I was going, and I
asked him if he would mind telling me how he found out how I was there, and
looking back at it I was kind of naive, I went to a relative and told no one else.
He had a wire in his hands which he showed me indicating it had come from the
Dallas office, naming the place where I was, and the exact address, and who I
was staying with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he ask to take pictures of you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your response?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. This was denied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did he ask you questions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He did, essentially the same questions which I have reiterated as
to the emergency treatment that was undertaken. He did not press the point
as to the number of bullets or anything of that, and I told him I had no knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
of that. He only asked about the emergency measures I had taken and
I related them to him as I have to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Subsequently, did an article appear about you in the Saturday
Evening Post?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly the circumstances surrounding the
appearance of that article as you felt them to be?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. We were contacted, not I directly but Dr. Shires, by the medical
editor of the Saturday Evening Post, this was all related to me by Dr. Shires,
in regard to a possible story. This was declined, since Dr. Shires and those of
us in the department felt that the news value was gone and this was commercialism,
and they told Dr. Shires, I am told, that they would not print anything.</p>

<p>However, an article appearing under a New York Herald Tribune uncopyrighted
by-line apparently was subsequently acquired by them and published.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was that article accurate, inaccurate, or what was the level
of accuracy of the contents thereof?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The level of accuracy was not very good at all. It was overly
dramatic, garish and in poor taste, and ethically damaging to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what way was it ethically damaging to you, Dr. Perry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. As you know, it is our policy that the physician's name in the
treatment of any patient be essentially kept quiet. There are unusual circumstances
surrounding this one, of course, and our names were made public.
But this mentions my name freely, published a photograph that apparently
was taken of me at the press conference and had previously appeared in a
newspaper, and a picture of the emergency room, trauma room No. 1, and
although most of the people in the medical profession, I have subsequently
been assured by the Society of Surgeons and AMA, that they realize I had
no part in it, which is obvious to them because of the gross inaccuracies. Nonetheless
it is harmful to me as a member of the faculty of the medical school to
have such an article in print.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, did you have occasion to discuss your observations
with Comdr. James J. Humes of the Bethesda Naval Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did that conversation occur?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. My knowledge as to the exact accuracy of it is obviously in doubt.
I was under the initial impression that I talked to him on Friday, but I understand
it was on Saturday. I didn't recall exactly when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have an independent recollection at this moment as to
whether it was on Friday or Saturday?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I have thought about it again and the events surrounding
that weekend were very kaleidoscopic, and I talked with Dr. Humes
on two occasions, separated by a very short interval of, I think it was, 30
minutes or an hour or so, it could have been a little longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the medium of your conversation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Over the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he identify himself to you as Dr. Humes of Bethesda?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state as specifically as you can recollect the conversation
that you first had with him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He advised me that he could not discuss with me the findings
of necropsy, that he had a few questions he would like to clarify. The initial
phone call was in relation to my doing a tracheotomy. Since I had made the
incision directly through the wound in the neck, it made it difficult for them to
ascertain the exact nature of this wound. Of course, that did not occur to me
at the time. I did what appeared to me to be medically expedient. And when
I informed him that there was a wound there and I suspected an underlying
wound of the trachea and even perhaps of the great vessels he advised me that
he thought this action was correct and he said he could not relate to me any
of the other findings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you relate to me in lay language what necropsy is?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Autopsy, postmortem examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the content of the second conversation which you
had with Comdr. Humes, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The second conversation was in regard to the placement of
the chest tubes for drainage of the chest cavity. And I related to him, as I
have to you, the indications that prompted me to advise that this be done at
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, did you observe any bruising of the neck muscles
of President Kennedy when you were engaged in your operative procedure that
you have described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. This bruising, as you describe, would have been obscured by
the fact that there was a large amount of blood, hematoma, present in the neck
and the mediastinum and hence all the blood tissues were covered by this blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A few moments ago in response to a question by Mr. McCloy I
believe you commented that, as you recollected it, very few of the doctors would
have had an opportunity to observe the hole in the President's neck and I think
you said that only you and Dr. Carrico would have had such an opportunity.
Can you state, with absolute certainty, at which point the various doctors arrived
in the room? And bear in mind on this that while you have not had the
opportunity to review the depositions, some of the other doctors have expressed
the view that they have had an opportunity to see the wound. Specifically, Dr.
M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins said in a deposition that he did see the wound, and I have not
had an opportunity to ask you that question before, because you made the
comment during the course of the testimony today.</p>

<p>But I would like your comment on, in your opinion, whether the other doctors
would have had an opportunity, perhaps, to observe the neck wound prior to
the tracheotomy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Since I don't know with accuracy the exact times of their arrival,
it is conceivable that others could have seen it. And Dr. Jenkins was apparently
one of the early arrivals in the room.</p>

<p>However, at the time that I arrived, as I related, Dr. Carrico was present
and Dr. Jones and I. Dr. Jones immediately directed himself toward obtaining
another intravenous infusion, and I immediately went to the neck wound. At
the time of arrival of the other surgeons which assisted me in the operation, I
had already made the incision.</p>

<p>Dr. Jenkins could have arrived at the time that I was preparing to make the
incision and seen the wound. It is possible, I don't know when he came in the
room. I know he did not examine the wound per se.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And similarly Dr. Jones has commented in the course of his
deposition about the situation with respect to the wound in the neck.</p>

<p>Based on your observations, would it be consistent with what you know
to be fact that he had an opportunity to examine the neck wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I know he might have seen it because he and I entered the room
simultaneously, we came down together. To my knowledge, he did not examine
the wound although he might have noted the wound present as I went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Specifically what did he do then as you went to work?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He was standing immediately on my left at that point, doing
a venesection, a cut down in the left arm for the administration of fluids so
he was able to observe the performance of the tracheotomy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In your opinion, Dr. Perry, was President Kennedy alive or dead
on arrival at Parkland?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The President was alive in that spontaneous ineffective respiratory
motions were observed by me, and although I never detected a pulse or a
heartbeat, I was told there was also electrical activity on the cardiotachyscope
when it was initially attached indicating there was spontaneous activity of
the heart.</p>

<p>He was, therefore alive for medical purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who told you about the electrical activity on the cardiotachyscope?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was any bullet found by you or by any other doctor at Parkland
in the President's body?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I found none. To the best of my knowledge neither did anyone
else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the President ever turned over at any time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Not by me nor did I see it done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present as long as any other doctor was present in
the emergency room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I think that at the time that I left trauma room number
one, I went outside, and washed my hands, and I opened the door briefly to
retrieve my coat which I had left there on the floor and the nurse handed me
my coat.</p>

<p>At that time as I recall Doctor Jenkins was still in the room and there were
several other people there including Mrs. Kennedy and the priest, and some
gentlemen whom I did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you make any effort to examine the clothing of
President Kennedy?.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why was it, Dr. Perry, that there was no effort made to examine
the clothing of President Kennedy and no effort to turn him over and examine
the back of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. At the termination of the procedure and after we had determined
that Mr. Kennedy had expired, I cannot speak for the others but as for
myself, my work was done. I fought a losing battle, and I actually obviously,
having seen a lot of wounds, had no morbid curiosity, and actually was rather
anxious to leave the room. I had nothing further to offer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With the President having been declared dead, did you consider
it was your function to make any further exploration of the President's
body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. This is not my function or my prerogative. This would be
undertaken by suitable authorities at the time of postmortem, people with
experience superior to mine in determining things of this sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was Mrs. Kennedy, if you know, during the course of the
treatment which you have described that you performed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I had the initial impression she was in the room most of the
time although I have been corrected on this. When I entered the room she
was standing by the door, rather kneeling by the door, and someone was standing
there beside her. I saw her several times during the course of the resuscitative
measures, when I would look up from the operative field to secure an instrument
from the nearby tray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Under your procedure who had the responsibility for declaring
that the President was dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. This was a combination of factors, Mr. Dulles, undertaken by
those of us all in attendance, by Dr. Clark and Dr. Jenkins and myself particularly
since we were the senior people there.</p>

<p>I was informed subsequently that Mrs. Kennedy left the room several times
to just outside the door but returned although as I say, I saw her several times
in the room. I did not speak to her nor she to me so I do not have any knowledge
as to exactly what she was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any wound in the President's chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any wound on the left side of the President's
head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you heretofore during the course of your testimony today
described all of the wounds in the President which you have observed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you and the other doctors affected, in your opinion, in
your treatment of the President by virtue of the fact that he was the President
of the United States?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; I am sure that is true. At the time that I was going
down the stairs to the emergency room I was, of course, quite concerned, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
knowing any of the circumstances surrounding the incident nor in what condition
I would find him, and at the time that I entered the room, and it was my
initial impression that he had a mortal wound.</p>

<p>At that point I directed myself to doing that which I could do and, of course,
the time then became quite compressed during the course of the procedures
and it was really not until afterwards that the full impact of what had happened
began to hit me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion to render any treatment to Governor
Connally at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I saw the Governor in regard to the consultation in regard to
the injury to his leg. As I related earlier I am consultant in vascular surgery
to the hospital, and the estimated course of the missile in his leg presupposed
that he might have an injury to his femoral artery or vein and Dr. Shires
asked me if I would put on a scrub suit and come to the operating room to
assist in case it was necessary to do some arterial surgery.</p>

<p>It was not, however, so I did not operate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time approximately did you arrive at the operating
room where Governor Connally was being cared for?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I don't know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it during the course of the operation performed by Dr.
Shires?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, At that time I was there during the time Dr. Shires was
there and Dr. Gregory was also operating on the arm at that point. Dr. Shaw
had completed his portion of the procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would have been after the press conference had been
completed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to render medical aid to Lee Harvey
Oswald on November 24?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Before you get to that may I get clear, Dr. Shires and Dr. Gregory
were in attendance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Shaw in addition.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, and Shaw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Shaw, Shires and Gregory?</p>

<p>Doctor <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. S-h-i-r-e-s.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Before you get to Oswald may I ask one question?
I am sure the doctor covered it. You said the minute you saw the President
you felt he had suffered a mortal wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You saw the wound immediately then?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Well, I saw his condition immediately, and as you are aware,
I have attended a lot of people with severe injuries.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. And he obviously was in extremis when I walked in the room.
And then I noted very cursorily the wound in the head and it was obvious that
this was an extremely serious wound.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was he still alive when you saw him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask, Mr. Specter, during the total time that you
were examining and treating the President, how much of his exposed body did
you see?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The upper trunk predominantly, Congressman Ford. His chest,
and, of course, his arms were bare, neck and head. I did not examine any
other portions of his body nor did I see any other portions except briefly when
I felt for the femoral pulse on the left side.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. From the waist on up the front?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe the treatment rendered to Mr. Oswald
at Parkland Memorial Hospital by yourself and by others as you observed it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. At the time I saw&mdash;starting with when I was called?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Well, I went immediately to the emergency room again, Dr.
Jones and I who also was in the hospital again, and told me that I was
the only attending surgeon present, and that they were bringing Mr. Oswald
out, and I was in the surgery suite and I went directly to the emergency room
just as he was being brought indoors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time was that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I really don't know, sir. It was about 11:15 or so when I was
up in surgery. I had been seeing a baby in regard to an operation we had
scheduled at 1 o'clock and then Dr. Jones came after me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did it take you approximately to travel from the
point where you received the notice that he was en route until your arrival at
the emergency room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No more than 2 or 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you say you arrived there simultaneously with Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Just as he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Precisely where in the hospital was it where you met Mr.
Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He was brought into the emergency room, trauma room number
two, and as they wheeled him in I came around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action did you take with respect to Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Well, there were numerous people in attendance, more so than
on the previous incident on Friday. He also obviously was quite seriously
injured. He was cyanotic, very blue and although he also was attempting
respirations, they were not effective, and an endotracheal tube was placed
in him by one of the anesthesiologists, I think Dr. Jenkins, and I examined
his chest and noted the entrance point of the bullet wound on the left side
and I could feel the bullet just under the skin on the right side, right rear
margin, indicating the bullet had passed entirely through his body and come
to rest under the skin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where through his body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I beg your pardon sir, the bullet entered approximately the
midaxillary line at about the 9th or 10th interspace on the left side of the
chest cage, and came to rest just under the rib margin on the right side under
the skin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you supply in lay language what cyanotic means?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Blue from lack of oxygen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you explain in lay language the midaxillary line?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It is about the mid portion of the fold extending down from
the armpit on the left. This is just rough because I glanced at that briefly
and determined the nature of the path of the bullet and from looking at him
it was obvious that this had traversed major structures in his body in order
to reach that particular place, so while a cutdown was being done again to
administer fluid, I asked someone to put in a left chest tube on him because it
appeared it went in and I recalled surgery until they were bringing him directly
up.</p>

<p>Dr. Tom Shires, Chief of the Surgical Services, came into the door at a point
and Dr. McClelland, and we left and went to surgery to change clothes and they
brought him from there immediately to surgery and we proceeded with the
operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present, if anyone, with Mr. Oswald at the time you
arrived there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. In the emergency room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Jenkins was there, Dr. M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins, Chief of Anesthesiology.</p>

<p>I think Dr. Giesecke was also there again, although I am not sure of that. I
saw Dr. Risk who is a resident in urology and I saw Dr. Dulany who is a
resident in surgery. Dr. Boland, I believe who is a resident in thoracic surgery
and, of course, Dr. Jones and myself, and there were several other people, the
nurses, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe briefly the physical layout utilized in taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Mr. Oswald from trauma room number two which you have already described
up to the operating room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. We have an express elevator that connects delivery room, operating
room, emergency room and it is approximately 20 yards from trauma room
two, I would estimate, just around the corner, in an even corridor and although
I was not there as they took him up, I was in the operating room preparing
and scrubbing, he was wheeled directly there to the express elevator
and taken to the second floor where the operating suites are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how long does it take to get a patient from the
trauma room up to the operating room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It depends on a lot of factors. One is if the elevator is there or
not or if it happens to be in surgery or in the delivery room. But I have on
occasion where it was necessary that you must go with all dispatch to the
operating room, have done it in a matter of a few minutes.</p>

<p>They brought him right in the door, placed him on the elevator with a finger
controlling the hemorrhage where you could take him directly to the operating
room. I have done that in a matter, I am sure, of less than 3 or 4 minutes if I
had to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how long did it take to get Oswald from trauma
room two to the operating room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I don't know, I was told subsequently it was 12 minutes from
the time we had him up. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How long was it from the time he was shot until he
reached the hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I have no knowledge of that, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was he conscious at any time so far as you know?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; he did not say a word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He was not conscious?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; and even had he been, of course, once we had the endotracheal
tube in he could not have spoken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was in charge of the operation performed on Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Tom Shires.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was in assistance with Dr. Shires?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I first assisted Dr. Shires and then Ronald Jones and Dr. McClelland
were also at the operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe the operative procedures employed on Mr.
Oswald please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes. From the nature of the trajectory of the wound and the
nature of the path of the bullet on the other side it was obvious that it had
traversed major vessels, the aorta and vena cava. The aorta and vena cava,
the heart area, and then a midline incision was made. A rapid prep with
iodine was done, the patient was draped. An incision was carried rapidly into
the abdominal cavity at which time we noticed approximately 3 litres of free
blood which is an excess of three quarts. This was removed by suction, lap
packs and by just moving it out in the form of clots with the hands. It was
noted there was considerable bleeding appearing in both the right upper and
left upper quadrants of the body. There was a large hematoma retroperitoneally
in the midline also, causing the bowels to be pushed forward rather strikingly.</p>

<p>We immediately dissected over the portal vein on the right since it was
apparently injured, and placed a vascular occlusive clamp of the Sittinsky type
in this area to control the bleeding. Noted an injury to the right kidney and
to the lobe of the liver. We also noted there was an injury to the stomach, the
pancreas, the spleen. At that point it became apparent that he had indeed
struck major vessels, and appeared to be the aorta, so the left colon was
reflected very rapidly in order to allow us to enter the space behind the
intestines, the retroperitoneal space, and at that point I controlled the bleeding
from the aorta by finger pressure below and above this area.</p>

<p>The bullet had knocked the superior mesenteric artery completely off the
aorta exposing a large area.</p>

<p>After I had controlled the bleeding Dr. Shires was able to dissect around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
area sufficient to allow us to gain control of the aorta, superior mesenteric
artery and the vena cava and the placement of vascular clamps across these
vessels in order to stop the hemmorhage.</p>

<p>At this point, he was being given blood and, of course, the suitable anesthesia
measures which were oxygen under pressure. He did not require an anesthetic
agent, I am told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who told you that, Dr. Perry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I think one of the residents did, one of the anesthesia residents.
We at that point had restored his blood pressure. I don't know the exact
recordings, but I was told subsequently it had returned to near normal levels
since we had the bleeding controlled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the situation with respect to his respiration at that
time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It was being assisted and controlled, of course, by anesthesiology.
This was no problem. We had a tube in place and was breathing for
him so he had no problem with respiration. This was completely under control
of anesthesia. The blood pressure was controlled and we stopped for a moment
to determine how we would best go about repairing the structures and which
would have priority, all the bleeding had stopped but, as I recall, the clamping
of the aorta at the level of the superior mesenteric artery means, of course,
that you must prevent blood from entering the kidneys, and this in itself can
be hazardous if extended, and therefore we decided this must be repaired
immediately in order to restore blood into the kidneys and the lower portion
of the body.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Jenkins informed me and Dr. Shires that his cardiac action was
becoming weak, and I don't remember all the details surrounding the medications
and the things that were done at this particular time, but he developed
a backward cardiac failure, his heart slowed abruptly and the blood pressure
fell again and it was apparent the tremendous blood loss he had had set
the stage for irreversible shock and lack of pumping action from the heart
although he was being given massive transfusions, I don't know the exact number,
probably he had 10 or 12 units. I believe it is in the record.</p>

<p>At this point when they told me a cardiac arrest had occurred as a result
of the hemorrhage and blood loss I took a knife and opened the left chest in
the fourth interspace and reached in to massage his heart, and the heart was
flabby, and dilated, and apparently contained very little blood.</p>

<p>I began to massage the heart, to maintain it as we infused the blood and
was able to obtain a palpable pulse in the carotid vessels going to the neck and
into the head. We were unable to get the heart to go, and it began to fibrillate
which is an uncoordinated motion of the muscles of the heart itself and the
successive electrical shocks were applied with the defibrillator and to stimulate
heart action, and we failed in this and the cardiac pacemaker was sewn in place,
and it was handed to me by the thoracic surgery resident, and I sewed it into
the heart to artificially induce heart action, this also was without benefit.</p>

<p>We were never able to restore effective heart action and then Dr. Jenkins
informed as neurologically he was not responding, that his reflexes were gone,
and he felt that he had expired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time did that occur?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I don't know, Mr. Specter, I would have to look at the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately how long after he arrived at the hospital did
that occur?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I don't know that, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you approximate the length of time of the operation itself?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. 45 minutes or so, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any question but that he was alive during the course
of your operative procedures?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Oh, no, no question. The fact is we were very close, I think,
to winning the battle. We have seen injuries of this magnitude, they rarely
survive, this is a very serious injury and to the best of my knowledge I have
not seen anyone with this particular set of injuries survive. But at one point
once we controlled the hemorrhage and once I had control of the aorta and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
able to stop the bleeding of that area I actually felt we had a very good chance
since everything had proceeded with expediency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been interviewed by any representative of the Federal
Government in connection with your treatment of President Kennedy, Dr.
Perry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By whom were you interviewed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I regret that I do not recall their names. I was interviewed
by two gentlemen from the Secret Service approximately the following week,
as I recall, and again about a month ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what questions were asked of you on the first interview
by the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Essentially in regard to the treatment and once again speculation
as to where the bullets might have originated and what the nature of
the wounds were and I was unable to supply them with any adequate information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were the responses given by you to the Secret Service on that
first interview essentially the same as you have given today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. With minor variations in wording, they are essentially the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately when did the second interview occur with
the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I think approximately a month ago, although I am not sure of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the content of that interview?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. A gentleman identified himself as being connected with the Warren
Commission and Secret Service. I asked for his credentials which he duly
supplied and he asked me in regard to any further information I might have
pertaining to the events of that weekend, and we reiterated some of these
statements which I made previously, and since I had nothing more to add, why
it was terminated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you supply any information which was in any way different
from that which you have testified to here today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. In essence; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the second interview, did the man identify himself to you
as a Secret Service agent who was conducting a further inquiry at the request
of the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; he said he was with the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did I discuss the facts within your knowledge or take your deposition
in Dallas on Wednesday, March 25, 1964?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was the information which you provided at that time in
advance of the deposition and during the course of the deposition itself the
same as the information which you provided here today concerning the treatment
of President Kennedy, your observations and opinions on President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have I made that transcript available to you this morning
before we started this testimony?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you at any time changed any opinion which you held
concerning any matter relating to President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you prepare a handwritten report on your care of President
Kennedy which became part of the record of Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which you identified during the course of the deposition proceeding
as being your report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any other notes of your own relating to any of
the matters which you testified here today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What was the condition of, general physical condition, apart
from the wounds, of Oswald, as you observed him? Was his body healthy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I made only a very cursory examination, Mr. McCloy. He appeared
rather thin to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Not, you wouldn't call him a muscular type?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, he would be what we would describe as a thinnish individual,
that is very thin; was wiry rather than bulky muscles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Were there any signs that you observed cursorily, symptoms
of any prior disease?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, I did not look for those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No distinguishing marks on the body that you saw, prior
operations?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I did not look. There was no evidence of previous surgical
operation on his abdomen, and I didn't examine anything else.</p>

<p>Of course, this also can be missed unless you are looking for it. We went
through the midline and unless one went looking for it we did not have time
and we would not see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, was the chest tube inserted in the President's chest
abandoned or was that operation or operative procedure completed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The chest tube, to be placed there, was supposedly placed into
the pleural cavity. However, I have knowledge that it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the reason for its not being placed into the
pleural cavity?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did not speak with certainty but at that point I think that
we were at the end of the procedure and they just did not continue with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had it become apparent at that time that the President expired?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That, I think, is probably true, but I did not state that with
certainty because I cannot state the exact sequence. I was employed myself
at the time, and I think if it had been determined that this was not in, it
would have been completed, if there was still time, but I am not sure of that.
That is speculation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With respect to the condition of the neck wounds, was it ragged
or pushed out in any manner?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, it was not. As I originally described it, the edges were
neither cleancut, that is punched out, nor were they very ragged. I realize
that is not a very specific description but it is in between those two areas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there blood in that area which tended to obscure your
view?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It was exuding blood during that procedure and thus I did not
examine it very closely. In retrospect, I think it would have been of much
more value had I looked at these things more carefully but I had directed my
attention to other things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Those complete my questions.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. McCloy?</p>

<p>Mr. Dulles?</p>

<p>Have you examined the autopsy report made by the officials in Bethesda?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir, I have.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Does your testimony conform to the facts stated in
that report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I think so. At the time the testimony which I have given here
of my knowledge without the&mdash;was given the same as it was without the basis
of that report. But now having had access to that report, I think it ties in
very nicely. I see no discrepancies at all. For example, had I known that
he had these other two wounds, it would have been much easier at the time
to state a little more categorically about the trajectory of the missiles, but
not knowing about those I could only speculate.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There is no basic conflict between what you have testified
to or what you have said previously, and the autopsy report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. None at all.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Just one question. I presume this question has been
asked.</p>

<p>This neck wound, was there any indication that that wound had come from
the front?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There is no way to tell, sir, for sure. As you may recall, passage
of a high velocity missile, the damage it does, is dependent on two factors,
actually, one being deformation of the missile, increase in its relative caliber,
and the other the expending of the energy of that missile in the object it strikes.</p>

<p>For example, the energy used to carry the missile beyond the object that it
struck is obviously not going to cause much of an injury. If there is a missile
of relatively high velocity, although I consider this a medium velocity weapon,
that the missile for entrance or exit had the bullet not been deformed would
not be substantially different, had it not been deformed nor particularly slowed
in its velocity.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. By that, you mean it would be difficult to determine
the point of exit and the point of entrance under those circumstances?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; unless one were able to ascertain the trajectory. If
you could, for example, make check points between what the missile might
have struck, then you could ascertain trajectory. But with a relatively high
velocity missile, this also is difficult due to the amount of blast injury which
occurs in enclosed tissues, similar to those I am sure you have seen to those
discussed, so blast injury can be an area remote from the exact passage of
the missile itself.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Of course, your main concern was to try to save the
President's life and <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; it actually never occurred to me until all the questions
began to come, and I was ill-prepared to meet them, but it never occurred to
me that, to investigate, because I was busy, and I have done these types of
things many times.</p>

<p>It just never occurred to me to look into it until afterwards.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Any questions, Dean Storey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Storey</span>. No, thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Murray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have one more question I would like to ask.</p>

<p>Did you know anything about the spent bullet that was found on, I don't
know what you call it&mdash;the litter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. On the carriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. On the carriage.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. My first knowledge of that was one of the newspaper publications
had said there was a bullet found there. I don't know now whether it was
or was not. I didn't find it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May I say, Mr. Dulles, on that subject, I took several depositions
on that subject in the Dallas Hospital and I think we have a reasonably conclusive
answer on that question; and, in fact, it came from the stretcher of
Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. They were quoted as having removed a bullet from Governor
Connally's leg, the press quoted that, but a bullet was not removed from Governor
Connally's leg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. There was no bullet removed from Governor Connally's leg, but
there was a wound there, but there was a very small fragment embedded in
the femur, as the deposition of Drs. Shaw, Shires, and Gregory will show.
But the bullet was found on a stretcher and the question arose as to whose
stretcher it was, and we have traced the two stretchers in a way so as to exclude
the possibility of its being the stretcher on which President Kennedy was carried,
and we have traced the path of Governor Connally's stretcher and have narrowed
it to two stretchers. And the bullet came off of one of the two stretchers, so that,
through the circumstances of the facts, it is reasonably conclusive that it came
from the stretcher of Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How long did it take you to go from where you were
when the page came to get down to trauma room No. 1?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. A matter of no more than a minute or so, Congressman Ford.
It is down one flight of stairs and the door is almost immediately adjacent to
the dining room where we would go and we did not wait on the elevator. We
went down the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How long after the President was brought in before you
went to trauma room No. 1?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That I don't know either. My last recollection in regard to time
was approximately 12:30 when I was having lunch prior to rounds, and Dr.
Jones picked up the page and as we went downstairs I took off my watch and
dropped it in my coat pocket, rather expecting to do some kind of procedure, and
I took off my coat and I never looked at the clock until afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. One more question, I want to get clear.</p>

<p>The extent to which you examined Governor Connally's wounds, as I gather,
you were asked to stand by.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Rather than to be involved in a close examination of the wounds.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. So you are not generally familiar?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; all I did was come into the operating room, put on a
scrub suit, cap and mask, and looked at the thigh wound before Dr. Shires
started the operation. That was the extent of the episode into the wound, and
I stayed there while he carried it down to the lower portion of the wound and
indicated there was no serious injury, and I left the operating room at that
point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And you didn't see the other two wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I didn't see the other wounds at all, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Thank you very much, Dr. Perry.</p>

<p>Your testimony has been most helpful.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 11:45 a.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT A. FRAZIER AND RONALD SIMMONS</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 9 a.m. on March 31, 1964, at 200 Maryland
Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Representative Hale
Boggs and John J. McCloy, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Melvin Aron Eisenberg,
assistant counsel; Norman Redlich, assistant counsel; Charles Murray and
Lewis Powell, observers; and Leon Jaworski, special counsel to the attorney
general of Texas.</p>

<h2 id="raf">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT A. FRAZIER</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Frazier, the purpose of today's hearing is to take
the testimony of yourself and Mr. Ronald Simmons.</p>

<p>You are, we understand, a firearms expert with the FBI, and Mr. Simmons is
a firearms expert with the Weapons System Division at Fort Meade, Md.</p>

<p>You are asked to provide technical information to assist the Commission
in this work.</p>

<p>Would you raise your right hand and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>You solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before this Commission
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help
you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be seated, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, will you give your name and position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Robert A. Frazier, Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation,
assigned to the FBI Laboratory, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And your education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I have a science degree which I received from the University
of Idaho.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you briefly state your training and experience in the
fields of firearms, firearms identification, and ballistics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Beginning in 1937, I was on the University of Idaho Rifle Team,
and the following year, 1938. In 1939 I enlisted in the National Guard and for
2 years was on the National Guard Rifle Team firing both small bore, or .22
caliber weapons, and the large bore, .30 caliber weapons, both being of the
bolt-action type weapons.</p>

<p>In 1939 and 1940 I instructed in firearms in the Army of the United States,
and acquired additional experience in firing of weapons, training in firing at moving
targets, additional training in firing the .45 caliber automatic and machineguns.
And to further my firearms, practical firearms training, I received in
1942 a training course offered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after
entering on duty with that organization in&mdash;on June 9, 1941. That firearms
training course consisted of a basic training in handguns&mdash;that is, revolvers
and automatic pistols, training in autoloading rifles, training in submachineguns,
shotguns, and various other types of firearms.</p>

<p>One year later, approximately 1943, I received a specialized administrative
firearms course which qualified me for training other agents in the field of
law-enforcement type firearms.</p>

<p>Over the past 23 years, I have received the regular FBI firearms training,
which is a monthly retraining in firearms, and a periodic, or every 4 years, detailed
retraining in the basic FBI firearms&mdash;the firearms training with the rifle,
submachinegun, shotgun, revolver.</p>

<p>In the FBI, training includes firing both at stationary targets and moving
targets with both revolver and rifle and shotgun, and includes firing at slow-fire
targets&mdash;that is aimed fire for accuracy and rapid fire to increase speed
of firing.</p>

<p>Generally in the field of firearms identification, where I have been assigned
for 23 years, I received specialized training given in the FBI Laboratory to
train me for the position of firearms identification specialist. In that field,
we make examinations of bullets and cartridge cases, firearms of various types,
for the purpose of identifying weapons as to their caliber, what they are, their
manufacturer, their physical characteristics, and determining the type of ammunition
which they shoot.</p>

<p>We examine ammunition of various types to identify it as to its caliber,
its specific designation, and the type or types of weapons in which it can be
fired, and we make comparisons of bullets to determine whether or not they
were fired from a particular weapon and make comparisons of cartridge cases
for the purpose of determining whether or not they were fired in a particular
weapon, or for determining whether or not they had been loaded into or extracted
from a particular weapon.</p>

<p>That training course lasted for approximately 1 year. However, of course,
the experience in firearms is actually part of the training and continues for
the entire time in which you are engaged in examining firearms.</p>

<p>Briefly, that is the summary of the firearms training I have had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you estimate the number of examinations you have made
of firearms to identify the firearms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Thousands, I would say&mdash;firearms comparisons&mdash;I have made in
the neighborhood of 50,000 to 60,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Have you written any articles on this subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. I have prepared an article for the "FBI Law Enforcement
Bulletin" on firearms identification, which is published as a reprint and provided
to any organization or person interested in the general field of firearms identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Have you read most of the literature on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Is there any classical book on this subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There are a number of fairly good texts.</p>

<p>The basic one, originally published in 1936, is by Maj. Julian S. Hatcher, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
later, as a general, rewrote his book "Firearms Investigation, Identification,
and Evidence."</p>

<p>There are many other books published on the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I ask that this person be accepted as a qualified witness
on firearms?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, I now hand you a rifle marked Commission Exhibit
139.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with this weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And do you recognize it by serial number or by your mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. By serial number on the barrel, and by my initials which appear
on various parts of the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, this is the rifle which was found on the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building on November 22.</p>

<p>Can you describe this rifle by name and caliber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is a caliber 6.5 Italian military rifle, commonly referred to in
the United States as a 6.5 mm. Mannlicher-Carcano.</p>

<p>It is a bolt-action clip-fed military rifle.</p>

<p>Do you wish a general physical description of the weapon at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, no; not at this time.</p>

<p>Can you explain the American equivalent to the 6.5 mm. caliber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is the same as .25 caliber. Such weapons in the United
States as the .25-20 Winchester, .25-35, the .250 Savage, and the .257 Roberts,
are all of the same barrel diameter, or approximately the same barrel diameter.
So a decimal figure of .257 inch is the equivalent of 6.5 mm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And can you explain what the caliber is a measure of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The caliber is the measure of the distance across the raised
portions or the lands in the barrel. The groove diameter, or the spirals cut in
the barrel to form the rifling, will be slightly larger&mdash;in this case between
7/1000ths and 8/1000ths of an inch larger than the actual bore diameter.</p>

<p>The caliber is normally determined by the bore diameter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain how you made the identification of this
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I identified it pictorially by comparing it with pictures in reference
books. And the actual identification was of the manufacturer's name
appearing on the barrel and serial number, which indicated it was an Italian
military rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you independently determine the caliber of the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you tell us how you did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The caliber and the caliber type may be confusing here.</p>

<p>The caliber, being the diameter of the barrel, is determined in two ways&mdash;one,
by comparing the barrel with 6.5mm. Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition,
which we also chambered in the weapon and determined that it actually fit the
weapon. And, secondly, we measured the width of the barrel with, a micrometer.
And in that connection, I would like to point out that we made a sulphur
cast of the muzzle of the weapon which permitted us to use a micrometer to determine
the land width and the groove width in the barrel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have that sulphur cast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that was made by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it was made by me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I ask that this be admitted as Commission Exhibit
No. 540.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 540, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there any reason that you can think of why this Exhibit
139 might be thought to be a 7.35-or 7.65-caliber rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. From outward appearances, it could be a 7.35-mm. rifle, because,
basically, that is what it is. But its mechanism has been rebarreled with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
6.5-mm. barrel. Photographs of the weapons are similar, unless you make a
very particular study of the photographs of the original model 38 Italian military
rifle, which is 7.35 mm.</p>

<p>Early in the Second World War, however, the Italian Government barreled
many of these rifles with a 6.5-mm. barrel, since they had a quantity of that
ammunition on hand. I presume that would be the most logical way of confusing
this weapon with one of a larger caliber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And is the 6.5-caliber weapon distinguished from the 7.35-caliber
weapon by name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it is; it is by the model number. The model 91/38 designates
the 6.5-mm. rifle, whereas the model 38 designates the 7.35.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you taken photographs of the various markings on the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have those with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Actually, I think we forwarded those photographs to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are these the photographs that you took, or had taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Has the Federal Bureau of Investigation been supplied with
information concerning the meanings and significances of these various markings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; we have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you state the source of that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This information came to us by mail as a result of an inquiry
of the Italian Armed Forces Intelligence Service, abbreviated SIFAR, by
letter dated March 26, 1964, through the FBI representative in Rome, Italy.</p>

<p>This information is classified as secret by the Italian Government, who have
advised that the material may be released to the Commission. However, they
desire the retention of the information in a secret category.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Is this essential to the proof?</p>

<p>If it is not, I think we would rather not have it, because the fewer things we
have to keep in secret, the better the situation is for us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Based on your experience with firearms, is the placement of a specific serial
number on a weapon generally confined to one weapon of a given type?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it is. Particularly&mdash;may I refer to foreign weapons particularly?</p>

<p>The serial number consists of a series of numbers which normally will be
repeated. However, a prefix is placed before the number, which actually must
be part of the serial number, consisting of a letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you been able to confirm that the serial number on this
weapon is the only such number on such a weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, without reference to any classified information, could you briefly describe
the markings shown on these photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The first photograph is an overall photograph of the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>These photographs&mdash;when you say "first photograph"&mdash;these photographs are
marked No. 1, No. 2, et cetera, on the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, they are.</p>

<p>Photograph No. 1 is an overall photograph of the rifle.</p>

<p>Photograph No. 2 is made of the top of the barrel, showing the serial number
C2766.</p>

<p>Photograph No. 3 is also of the top of the rifle, showing a portion of the inscription
on the telescopic sight, and the figures 1940, which is the manufacturer's
date, the words "Made Italy" and a figure in the form of a crown, under that
the letters "R-E," and then a portion of the word "Terni."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain the significance of "Terni?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Terni is the location for an Italian ordnance plant in Italy where
rifles are made, and it is apparent that this weapon was made in Terni, because
it is stamped with that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the significance of that crown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I think that would be just an Italian identification mark or proof
mark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And are the words "Made Italy" likely to have been put
on the weapon at the time of manufacture or subsequently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; the words "Made Italy" would be stamped on the
weapon by a purchaser or an individual desiring to send the weapon to another
country, to establish actually its origin.</p>

<p>Photograph No. 4 is again of the top of the weapon showing the same information&mdash;1940,
"Made Italy," the crown, the place it was made, and the inscription
"Caliber 6.5" across the top of the rear sight.</p>

<p>Photograph No. 5 shows a small circle which appears on the forward end of
the receiver, or that portion into which the barrel is screwed, with the words
"TNI" in the circle, and over these letters is again a small crown. This could
be a proof mark or an inspector's stamp.</p>

<p>Photograph No. 6 is of an inscription on the side of the rear sight which has
the appearance of the letter "i," or the letter "l," followed by a capital letter
"A," and the capital letter "G," with the numbers "47," and "2," stamped underneath
them. I do not know what the significance of that is. It could be, again,
an inspector's stamp or a proof mark of some type.</p>

<p>Photograph No. 7 is made of the cocking piece on the end of the bolt, which
gives the word "Rocca." This apparently would be the name of the manufacturer
of that part of the rifle.</p>

<p>Photograph No. 8 is an inscription "PG" on the top of the bolt of the weapon.
This inscription&mdash;I do not know of my own knowledge what that is&mdash;but it could
be the mark of a manufacturer or a proof mark or an inspector's mark made at
the time the handle was made to be welded to the bolt.</p>

<p>Photograph No. 9 was taken of the bottom of the receiver of the weapon, with
the stock removed. It shows the Number "40," which could refer again to the
year of manufacture, 1940, on the receiver, and at the rear of the photograph
a small lettered inscription referring again to an inspector stamp, a proof stamp,
of some nature. The identity of this, I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I ask that these photographs be admitted as
a group under the number 541.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You are going to put all of them in under one number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes. They have the subnumbers on the back, which will
differentiate them.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 541, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain why someone might call Exhibit 139 a
German-made Mauser rifle or a Mauser bolt-action rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The Mauser was one of the earliest, if not the earliest, and
the basic bolt-action rifle, from which many others were copied. And since
this uses the same type of bolt system, it may have been referred to as a
Mauser for that reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does this weapon show&mdash;how much use does this weapon
show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The stock is worn, scratched. The bolt is relatively smooth, as
if it had been operated several times. I cannot actually say how much use the
weapon has had. The barrel is&mdash;was not, when we first got it, in excellent
condition. It was, I would say, in fair condition. In other words, it showed
the effects of wear and corrosion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is this <span class="locked">weapon&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I didn't get that last.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It showed the effects of wear and corrosion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is this weapon used when it is sold into the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it is a surplus type of weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that it is impossible to attribute any given amount of
wear to the last user?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it is impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you measured the dimensions of this rifle assembled,
and disassembled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you give us that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The overall length is 40.2 inches. It weighs 8 pounds even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. With the scope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, with the scope.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And the sling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is with the sling, yes, sir. The sling weighs 4¾ ounces.
The stock length is 34.8 inches, which is the wooden portion from end to end with
the butt plate attached. The barrel and action from the muzzle to the rear of
the tang, which is this portion at the rearmost portion of the metal, is 28.9 inches.
The barrel only is 21.18 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say, "this portion," Mr. Frazier, I don't think that is
coming down clear in the record. I wonder whether you could rephrase that so
as to describe the part of the barrel or part of the stock to which you are
pointing when you say "tang."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The tang is the rear of the receiver of the weapon into which
the rear mounting screw is screwed to hold the rearmost part of the metal
action of the weapon into the wooden stock. From the end of that portion to
the muzzle of the weapon is 28.9 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the length of the longest component when the rifle is
dissembled, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 34.8 inches, which is the length of the stock, the wooden portion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe to us the telescopic sight on the rifle in
terms <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Before you get to the sight, can I ask a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. How soon after the assassination did you examine this rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We received the rifle the following morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Received it in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And you immediately made your examination of it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We made an examination of it at that time, and kept it temporarily
in the laboratory.</p>

<p>It was then returned to the Dallas Police Department, returned again to the
laboratory&mdash;the second time on November 27th, and has been either in the
laboratory's possession or the Commission's possession since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you examined the rifle the first time, you said that it
showed signs of some corrosion and wear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Was it what you would call pitted, were the lands in good shape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; the lands and the grooves were worn, the corners were
worn, and the interior of the surface was roughened from corrosion or wear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Was there metal fouling in the barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I did not examine it for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Could you say roughly how many rounds you think had been
fired since it left the factory, with the condition of the barrel as you found
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I could not, because the number of rounds is not an
indication of the condition of the barrel, since if a barrel is allowed to rust,
one round will remove that rust and wear the barrel to the same extent as
10 or 15 or 50 rounds just fired through a clean barrel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you describe the telescopic sight on the rifle? Magnification,
country of origin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is a four-power telescopic sight employing crosshairs in it
as a sighting device, in the interior of the scope.</p>

<p>It is stamped "Optics Ordnance Incorporated, Hollywood California," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
under that is the inscription "Made in Japan." It is a very inexpensive Japanese
telescopic sight.</p>

<p>The mount attached to it was also made in Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you removed the mount?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How many holes did you find drilled into the receiver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There are two holes in the receiver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you form an opinion as to whether these were original
holes or whether new holes&mdash;new and larger holes had been formed over the
original holes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Normally, the receiver would have no holes at all, and would
have to be drilled and tapped for the screws. In the sight itself there normally
are three holes, two of which have been enlarged to accommodate the
two mounting screws presently holding the mount to the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you think, based on your experience with types of screws
used in mounts, that these were the original screws and the original holes for
the screws?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I could not say&mdash;I could not answer that specifically. However,
they appear to be the same type of screw as is present on the rest of the mount&mdash;although
they are somewhat larger in size than the remaining hole which is
present in the lower portion of the mount.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, I now hand you a rifle which is marked C-250. Are
you familiar with this rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe it briefly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is an identical rifle physically to the rifle Commission's Exhibit
139, in that it is the same caliber, 6.5-mm. Mannlicher-Carcano Italian
Military rifle, Model 91/38.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you attempt to determine by use of this rifle whether
the scope was mounted on Exhibit 139 by the firm which is thought to have
sold Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Would you repeat that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Did you make an attempt to determine, by use of this C-250, whether the
firm which had sold Exhibit 139 had mounted the scope on Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe how you made that attempt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We contacted the firm, Klein's Sporting Goods in Chicago, and
asked them concerning this matter to provide us with a similar rifle mounted in
the way in which they normally mount scopes of this type on these rifles, and
forward the rifle to us for examination.</p>

<p>In this connection, we did inform them that the scope should be in approximately
this position on the frame of the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Pardon me, Mr. Frazier. When you say "this position," so
that the record is clear could <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes; in the position in which it now is, approximately three-eighths
of an inch to the rear of the receiver ring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. On <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. On the C-250 rifle.</p>

<p>When we received the rifle C-250, we examined the mount and found that
two of the holes had been enlarged, and that screws had been placed through
them and threaded into the receiver of the C-250 rifle.</p>

<p>The third hole in the mount had not been used.</p>

<p>We also found that an identical scope to the one on the Commission's rifle
139 was present on the C-250 rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Were the screws used in mounting the C-250 rifle&mdash;in mounting
the scope on the C-250 rifle&mdash;type of screws as those used in mounting the scope
on Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the holes were the same dimensions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, they are. And the threads in the holes are the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like C-250 admitted into evidence as
Commission Exhibit 542.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 542, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. At this time I will interrupt to say I must now leave to
attend a session of the Supreme Court, and I will return at the conclusion of the
session.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. McCloy will preside at the Commission hearing, and
in the event he should be required to leave, Mr. McCloy, whatever Commissioner
is here will conduct the examination in his absence.</p>

<p>(At this point, Chairman Warren withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you examined the sling on Commission Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you feel that this is&mdash;that this sling was originally manufactured
as a rifle sling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; it is not in any way similar to a normal sling for a
rifle. It appears to be a sling from some carrying case, camera bag, musical-instrument
strap, or something of that nature.</p>

<p>We have made attempts to identify it, with no success.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Apart from the addition of this sling and mounting of the
telescopic sight, have any modifications been made in the C-139 rifle&mdash;in the
Commission Exhibit 139 rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You would suggest, I gather, Mr. Frazier, that this is a homemade
sling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it appears to have been cut to length by inserting
this strap, or this sling, on the rifle, and then trimming off the excess ends
of the two straps to fit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. How would that broad patch on the sling&mdash;how would that
be used, in your judgment, in firing the rifle? Would it be wrapped around
the base of <span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I find it very difficult to use the rifle with a sling at all. The
sling is too short, actually, to do more than put your arm through it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You get quite a leverage with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir, you do, in one direction. But it is rather awkward
to wrap the forward hand into the sling in the normal fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. This gives a pretty <span class="locked">tight&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It can be used. But I don't feel that actually the position
of this broad piece is of too much significance as far as use of the sling goes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But certainly the sling would tend to steady the aim, even in
this crude form?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It would make more easy an offhand shot than if you didn't
have a sling? It would make it more accurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would assist more in offhand than any other type of shooting,
yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Returning to the scope for a moment, on the basis of the
experiment, so to speak, which you had Klein's conduct, would you form an
opinion as to whether the telescopic sight was mounted on Exhibit 139&mdash;was
likely to have been mounted&mdash;by Klein's, or likely to have been mounted
subsequently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I could not deduce from that&mdash;from the way the scope
is mounted&mdash;who mounted it. I can only say that the two are mounted in identical
fashion. And it is possible that the same person or persons mounted the
two scopes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you briefly explain the operation of this rifle, the bolt
action and the clip-feed mechanism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; the weapon is loaded by turning up the bolt handle,
drawing the bolt to the rear, and inserting the clip from the top of the weapon,
after the clip has been loaded with the number of rounds you desire to load.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
The maximum number of rounds the clip holds is six. However, the weapon
can be loaded with a clip holding 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 round.</p>

<p>This is done by inserting the clip in the rear portion of the ejection port, and
pushing it downwards until it clears the bottom of the bolt. The weapon
then is loaded by moving the bolt forward. It picks up one cartridge out of the
clip, carries it into the chamber of the weapon, and the bolt is then locked
by turning down.</p>

<p>To fire the weapon, it is merely necessary to pull the trigger, since the closing
of the bolt has cocked the cocking piece on the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you proceed to show the extraction and ejection
mechanism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. The extraction is merely by raising the bolt and
drawing it to the rear. When the cartridge is first loaded, the rim on the base
of the cartridge is caught under the extractor in the face of the bolt, so that
drawing the bolt to the rear draws the fired cartridge or a loaded cartridge
if it has not been fired, out of the chamber to the rear, where the opposite side
of the cartridge strikes a projection in the ejection port called the ejector.
The ejector strikes on the opposite side of the case from the extractor, causing
the shell to be thrown out of the weapon on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, to fire the next shot, is any further action necessary,
apart from closing the bolt and pulling the trigger, if remaining cartridges
are in the clip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you pull out the clip and explain any markings you
find on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The only markings are the manufacturer's markings, "SMI,"
on the base of the clip, and a number, 952. The significance of that number
I am not aware of. It could be a part number or a manufacturer's code number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there any reason that you can think of why someone might
call that a five-shot clip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir, unless they were unfamiliar with it. There is an area
of confusion in that a different type of rifle shooting larger ammunition, such
as a .30-06 or a German Mauser rifle, uses five-shot clips, and the five-shot clip
is the common style or size of clip, whereas this one actually holds six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you had occasion to purchase ammunition for this rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does the ammunition come in the clip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Normally it does not. The ammunition that we have purchased
for this rifle comes in 20-shot boxes. It is possible&mdash;and I say this as a result of
reading advertisements&mdash;to buy ammunition for this rifle, and to receive a clip
or clips at the same time, but not necessarily part of the same shipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you ordered C-250, which is now Commission Exhibit
542, did you receive a clip with that rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you deduce, therefore, that the clip&mdash;that someone wishing
to shoot that rifle and use a clip in the rifle would have purchased the clip
later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. They would have to acquire it from some source, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is it commonly available?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Can you use that rifle without the clip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. What is the advantage of the clip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It permits repeated firing of the weapon without manually loading
one shot at a time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The only other way you can fire it is by way of manual load?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; one shot at a time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you say a six-cartridge clip, could that gun have been fired
with the clip fully loaded and another one in the chamber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The same as the .30-06?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; the weapon will hold a maximum of seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I now hand you a cartridge in an envelope, marked Commission
Exhibit 141. Are you familiar with this cartridge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I am. I received this cartridge for examination in the FBI
laboratory, submitted to me as a cartridge removed from the rifle at the time it
was recovered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe that cartridge in terms of name, manufacturer,
and country of origin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is a 6.5 mm. Mannlicher-Carcano cartridge, manufactured by
the Western Cartridge Co., at East Alton, Ill.</p>

<p>It is loaded with a full metal-jacketed bullet of the military type. Cartridges
of this type which I have examined, having this type of bullet, have bullets
weighing 160 to 161 grains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you mentioned that cartridge as being a Mannlicher-Carcano
cartridge, could that be fired, for example, in a Mannlicher 6.5 Schoenauer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I am not familiar with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is the normal sporting rifle&mdash;that Mannlicher Schoenauer
is the normal 6.5 Austrian sporting rifle that you buy. I just wondered if it was
the same cartridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I am sorry. I don't know whether there is a distinction between
these two or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I happen to have one of those. And I was just wondering if it
is the same cartridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, I now hand you a series of three cartridge cases.
I ask you whether you are familiar with these cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I am. I received these cartridge cases on two different
occasions for examination in the laboratory, and comparison with the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do these cases have your mark on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; they do. Each is marked with my initials and the inscription
for identification purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce these cartridge cases
into evidence as Commission Exhibits 543, 544 and 545.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The articles referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 543, 544,
and 545 and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Will you introduce evidence to show where they came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, sir, the record will show at the conclusion of the hearings
where they came from. This witness is able to identify them only as to his
examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I understand that. I understand that witness cannot identify
them. But I simply asked for the record whether you have evidence to show
where they did come from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes; for the record, these cartridges were found on the sixth
floor of the School Book Depository Building. They were found near the southeast
corner window&mdash;that is, the easternmost window on the southern face of the
sixth floor of that building.</p>

<p>Mr. Frazier, are these cartridge cases which have just been admitted into
evidence the same type of cartridge&mdash;from the same type of cartridge&mdash;as you
just examined, Commission Exhibit No. 141?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is, 6.5 mm. Mannlicher-Carcano, manufactured by the
Western Cartridge Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You gave the weight of the bullet which is found in this type
of cartridge. Could you give us a description of the contour of the bullet, and
its length?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The bullet has parallel sides, with a round nose, is fully jacketed
with a copper-alloy coating or metal jacket on the outside of a lead core. Its
diameter is 6.65 millimeters. The length&mdash;possibly it would be better to put
it in inches rather than millimeters. The diameter is .267 inches, and a length
of 1.185, or approximately 1.2 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You say that the diameter is 6.65. Did you mean 6.65 or 6.5
millimeters?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I was looking for that figure on that. It is about 6.6&mdash;6.65
millimeters.</p>

<p>The bullet, of course, will be a larger diameter than the bore of the weapon
to accommodate the depths of the grooves in the barrel.</p>

<p>On the base of the bullet is a crimp ring, or a cannelure, which is located two-tenths
of an inch from the base up the bullet and which is 6/100ths of an inch
in width&mdash;that is, it is a band around the bullet 6/100ths of an inch wide.</p>

<p>I believe that is a description of the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you tested Commission Exhibit 139 with the type of
ammunition you have been looking at to determine the muzzle velocity of that
type of ammunition in this weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. The tests were run to determine the muzzle velocity
of this rifle, using this ammunition, at the Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington, D.C., on December 2, 1963, using two different lots of ammunition&mdash;Lot
No. 6,000 and Lot No. 6,003.</p>

<p>I might point out that there were four lots of ammunition manufactured by
the Western Cartridge Co., only two of which are available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give the results?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Possibly I can give the results shot by shot, so the record will
show each one, and then give an average for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The first shot, Lot 6,000, the velocity was 2199.7 feet per second.</p>

<p>Shot No. 2, Lot 6,000, velocity 2,180.3 feet per second.</p>

<p>The third shot, velocity&mdash;same lot&mdash;velocity 2,178.9 feet per second.</p>

<p>The third shot, velocity&mdash;and this is Lot No. 6,003&mdash;velocity was 2,184.8 feet
per second.</p>

<p>The fourth shot, Lot No. 6,003, was 2,137.6 feet per second.</p>

<p>Fifth shot, Lot No. 6,000, 2,162.7 feet per second.</p>

<p>The sixth shot, Lot 6,003, 2,134.8 feet per second.</p>

<p>An average of all shots of 2,165 feet per second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How would you characterize the differences between the
muzzle velocities of the various rounds in terms of whether that difference
was a large or small difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This is a difference well within the manufacturer's accepted
standards of velocity variations. They permit in their standard ammunition
manual, which is a guide to the entire industry in the United States, a 40-foot-per-second,
plus or minus, variation shot to shot in the same ammunition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you calculated the muzzle energy of this 6.5 millimeter
ammunition in this weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was furnished by letter to the Commission. Yes, sir&mdash;the
muzzle energy was calculated on the basis of the average velocity of 2,165 feet
per second as 1,676 foot-pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This is a calculation rather than a measurement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Necessarily a calculation, because it is merely a term used to
compare one bullet against another rather than for any practical purposes
because&mdash;because of the bullet's extremely light weight.</p>

<p>The bullet's velocity and weight, and gravity enter into the determination of
its energy in foot-pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is the 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano with which we are
dealing an accurate type of ammunition as opposed to other types of military
ammunition&mdash;as compared, I should say, with other types of military
ammunition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say it is also accurate. As other types of ammunition
the 6.5 millimeter cartridge or bullet is a very accurate bullet, and ammunition
of this type as manufactured in the United States would give fairly reasonable
accuracy. Other military cartridges may or may not give accurate results.</p>

<p>But the cartridge inherently is an accurate cartridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is this type of cartridge readily available for purchase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it is. Information we have indicates that 2 million rounds
of this ammunition was reimported into this country and placed on sale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 141, the cartridge found in the
chamber&mdash;I should say, was found in the chamber. Do you draw any inference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
from the fact that the cartridge was found in the chamber? In your experience,
does one automatically reload whether or not one intends to fire, or is there a
special significance in the fact that the cartridge had been chambered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say no, there would be no inference which I could
draw based on human behavior as to why someone would or would not reload
a cartridge. Normally, if you were&mdash;in my experience&mdash;shooting at some object,
and it was no longer necessary to shoot, you would not reload.</p>

<p>You may or may not reload. It would be a normal thing to automatically
reload. But not necessarily in every instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you have any information of your own knowledge as to
whether this cartridge was in the chamber or not at the time the rifle was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Only as furnished to me&mdash;it was submitted as having been
removed from the rifle by the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. As having been removed from the chamber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. From the chamber of the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But you did not remove it yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you make a test to determine the pattern of the cartridge-case
ejection of Commission Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I made two studies in connection with the ejection
pattern&mdash;one to determine distance and one to determine the angle at which
the cartridge cases leave the ejection port.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And did you summarize your examination by diagrams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you show us those diagrams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. In this <span class="locked">diagram&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Excuse me just a second, Mr. Frazier.</p>

<p>Were these diagrams prepared by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; they were&mdash;not the actual physical diagrams, but the
figures on the diagrams were furnished by me to the draftsman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I introduce these diagrams as Commission
Exhibits Nos. 546 and 547?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 546 and
547, and were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you give us the results of your tests by using these
diagrams, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>In this test, Commission Exhibit 546, the diagram illustrates the positions
on the floor at which cartridge cases landed after being extracted and ejected
from the rifle, Commission's Exhibit 139. In the top portion of Exhibit 546,
the barrel was held depressed at a 45-degree angle, and in the lower half of the
exhibit it shows the pattern with the barrel held in a horizontal position.
Each spot marked with a figure on the diagram shows where one cartridge
case landed in both instances, and each one is marked with the distance and
the angle to which the cartridge case was ejected.</p>

<p>With the barrel held in the depressed condition, all of the cartridge cases
landed within an 85-inch circle located 80 degrees to the right front of the
rifle. That may be confusing. It was 80 degrees to the right from the line
of sight of the rifle and at a distance of 86 inches from the ejection port.</p>

<p>Now, this circle will not necessarily encompass all cartridge cases ejected from
the rifle, since the ejection is determined, not only by the angle of the weapon,
but more by the force with which the bolt is operated. A very light force
on the bolt can cause the cartridge case to tip gently out and fall at your
feet. However, under normal conditions of reloading in a fairly rapid manner,
we found the cartridge cases to land in this circle.</p>

<p>The same situation is true of the test made with the muzzle in the horizontal
condition.</p>

<p>All of the cartridge cases landed within a 47-inch circle, which was located at
right angles to the ejection port, or 90 degrees from the line of sight, and
at a distance 80 inches from the ejection port.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
In both of these tests, the ejection port of the weapon was held 32 inches
above the floor.</p>

<p>In the second test performed, Commission Exhibit 547, the test was made
to ascertain how high above the ejection port a cartridge case would fly as
it was being ejected.</p>

<p>After ejecting numerous cartridge cases from the weapon with the barrel
held in a depressed condition, it was found that the cartridge cases did not
exceed two inches above the level of the ejection port. And with the muzzle held
horizontally, it did not exceed 12 inches above the level of the ejection port.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In making these tests, was the bolt pulled with a normal
degree of rifle pull?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was pulled with various pulls, to determine what the effect
would be with different speeds of the bolt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How did you select the distance above the floor at which
the rifle was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We selected a distance which we thought might be typical of
a condition which would give an overall picture of the ejection pattern, and
not from any basis of previous information as to possibly how the weapon
had been fired previously. Thirty-two inches happened to be approximately
table height, so that we could control the height of the weapon readily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I now hand you three Commission Exhibits, 510, 511, and 512,
which are photographs which have been identified as giving the location of the
cartridges&mdash;cartridge cases&mdash;Nos. 543, 544, and 545, on the sixth floor of the
School Book Depository Building. I ask you to examine these pictures, and to
determine whether if the rifle had been fired from the window shown in
these pictures, the location of the cartridge cases is consistent with the results
of the tests you ran to determine the ejection patterns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say yes; it is consistent&mdash;although the cartridge cases
are&mdash;two of them&mdash;against the wall. There is a stack of boxes fairly near the
wall, and the position of the cartridge cases could very well have been affected by
the boxes. That is, they could strike the box and bounce for several feet, and
they could have bounced back and forth in this small area here and come
to rest in the areas shown in the photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In making your tests, did you notice much ricochet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; considerable. Each time a cartridge case hit the floor,
it would bounce anywhere from 8 inches to 10 to 15 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Make a lot of noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; a clatter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you tested Commission Exhibit 139 to determine its
accuracy under rapid-fire conditions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe these tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. A series of three tests were made. When we first received the
rifle, there was not an opportunity to test it at long range, so we tested it
at short range. After we had obtained sample bullets and cartridge cases
from it, we fired accuracy and speed tests with it. Three examiners did the
firing, all three being present at the same time.</p>

<p>The first tests were made at 15 yards, and shooting at a silhouette target.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. A silhouette of a man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. A paper silhouette target of a man; yes.</p>

<p>Possibly you may wish to mark these, to refer to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. These targets were made by you or in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. These are actually copies of the actual targets. I have the
actual targets here, if you would rather use those. However, the markings
show better on the copies than they do on the actual targets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I request permission to introduce the copies
for the reasons given, as Commission Exhibits 548 and 549.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You have made these copies, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, I had them made. They are actual xerox copies of the
original targets, which are black, and do not show the markings placed around
the holes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. Frazier, you have the original targets that were used in this experiment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Were you one of the three that fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Can you identify your target as distinguished from the other
two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do you have the target that you fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I fired&mdash;yes, I do. However, another examiner also fired at
this same target.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Have you made a copy of that&mdash;or did you cause a copy of that
target to be made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And you have that with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Have you marked it yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. No. That would be 548.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Suppose you identify that copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This copy that you are presenting to us has initials at the
bottom "CC-R-CK"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the numbers and letters D-2 on the right-hand margin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that has been copied under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That can be admitted as Commission Exhibit 548.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 548, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Now, is Commission Exhibit 548 an accurate copy of the target
which you have&mdash;that you fired, and which you presented?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you also have a copy here which has the name on it
Killion, and similar initials, letters, and numbers to the other target. Is this an
accurate copy which you had prepared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. That was the target fired by Charles Killion in my
presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have this admitted as 549?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 549, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This test was performed at 15 yards, did you say, Mr.
Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. And this series of shots we fired to determine actually
the speed at which the rifle could be fired, not being overly familiar with this
particular firearm, and also to determine the accuracy of the weapon under
those conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And could you give us the names of the three agents who
participated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. Charles Killion, Cortlandt Cunningham, and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. November 27, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How many shots did each agent fire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Killion fired three, Cunningham fired three, and I fired three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And do you have the times within which each agent fired
the three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. Killion fired his three shots in nine seconds, and they are
shown&mdash;the three shots are interlocking, shown on Commission Exhibit No. 549.</p>

<p>Cunningham fired three shots&mdash;I know the approximate number of seconds
was seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
Cunningham's time was approximately seven seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you at a later date confirm the exact time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you will do that by letter to the Commission, or if you
happen to come back by oral testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And your time, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. For this series, was six seconds, for my three shots, which
also were on the target at which Mr. Cunningham fired, which is Exhibit 548.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you characterize the dispersion of the shots on the
two targets which you have been showing us, 548 and 549?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The bullets landed approximately&mdash;in Killion's target, No. 549,
approximately 2½ inches high, and 1 inch to the right, in the area about the
size of a dime, interlocking in the paper, all three shots.</p>

<p>On Commission Exhibit 548, Cunningham fired three shots. These shots were
interlocking, or within an eighth of an inch of each other, and were located
approximately 4 inches high and 1 inch to the right of the aiming point. The
three shots which I fired were&mdash;landed in a three-quarter inch circle, two of
them interlocking with Cunningham's shots, 4 inches high, and approximately 1
inch to the right of the aiming point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe the second series of tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The second test which was performed was two series of three
shots at 25 yards, instead of 15 yards. I fired both of these tests, firing them
at a cardboard target, in an effort to determine how fast the weapon could be
fired primarily, with secondary purpose accuracy.</p>

<p>We did not attempt&mdash;I did not attempt to maintain in that test an accurate
rate of fire.</p>

<p>This is the actual target which I fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that target has all six holes in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;two series of three holes, the first three holes being
marked with the No. 1, and the second series being marked No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like this introduced as 550.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 550, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you describe for the record the dispersion on the two
series?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. The first series of three shots were approximately&mdash;from
4 to 5 inches high and from 1 to 2 inches to the right of the aiming point,
and landed within a 2-inch circle. These three shots were fired in 4.8 seconds.
The second series of shots landed&mdash;one was about 1 inch high, and the other
two about 4 or 5 inches high, and the maximum spread was 5 inches.</p>

<p>That series was fired in 4.6 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And do you have the date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That also was on the 27th of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Same date as the first tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you performed one more test, I believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. We fired additional targets at 100 yards on the
range at Quantico, Va., firing groups of three shots. And I have the four targets
we fired here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like these admitted as 551, 552, 553,
and 554.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 551
through 554, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Who fired these shots, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I fired them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you characterize the dispersion on each of the four
targets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
On Commission Exhibit 551 the three shots landed approximately 5 inches
high and within a 3½-inch circle, almost on a line horizontally across the
target. This target and the other targets were fired on March 16, 1964 at
Quantico, Va. These three shots were fired in 5.9 seconds.</p>

<p>The second target fired is Commission Exhibit 552, consisting of three shots
fired in 6.2 seconds, which landed in approximately a 4½ to 5-inch circle located
4 inches high and 3 or 4 inches to the right of the aiming point.</p>

<p>Commission Exhibit No. 553 is the third target fired, consisting of three shots
which landed in a 3-inch circle located about 2½ inches high and 2 inches to
the right of the aiming point.</p>

<p>These three shots were fired in 5.6 seconds.</p>

<p>And Commission Exhibit No. 554, consisting of three shots fired in 6.5 seconds,
which landed approximately 5 inches high and 5 inches to the right of
the aiming point, all within a 3½-inch circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The first one is not exactly 5 inches to the right, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir. The center of the circle in which they all landed would
be about 5 inches high and 5 inches to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, could you tell us why, in your opinion, all the
shots, virtually all the shots, are grouped high and to the right of the aiming
point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. When we attempted to sight in this rifle at Quantico,
we found that the elevation adjustment in the telescopic sight was not sufficient
to bring the point of impact to the aiming point. In attempting to adjust and
sight-in the rifle, every time we changed the adjusting screws to move the
crosshairs in the telescopic sight in one direction it also affected the movement
of the impact or the point of impact in the other direction. That is, if we
moved the crosshairs in the telescope to the left it would also affect the elevation
setting of the telescope. And when we had sighted-in the rifle approximately,
we fired several shots and found that the shots were not all landing in the same
place, but were gradually moving away from the point of impact. This was
apparently due to the construction of the telescope, which apparently did not
stabilize itself&mdash;that is, the spring mounting in the crosshair ring did not stabilize
until we had fired five or six shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Pardon me, Mr. Frazier. Have you prepared a diagram of
the telescopic sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I wonder whether you could show us that now to help illustrate
the point you are making.</p>

<p>Let me mark that.</p>

<p>This diagram was prepared by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And <span class="locked">illustrates&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Excuse me. The actual diagram was copied by me from a
textbook, showing a diagrammatic view of how a telescopic crosshair ring is
mounted in a telescope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This is a generalized diagram, rather than a diagram of the
specific scope on Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it is. However, I have checked the scope on Exhibit 139
and found it to be substantially the same as this diagram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this admitted as 555?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 555, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 555 is a diagrammatic drawing of the
manner in which the crosshair ring is mounted in Exhibit 139, showing on the
right-hand side of the diagram a circular drawing indicating the outer part of the
tube, with an inner circle with a crossed line in it representing the crosshairs
in the telescope.</p>

<p>There is an elevation-adjusting screw at the top, which pushes the crosshair
ring down against a spring located in the lower left-hand portion of the circle,
or which allows the crosshair ring to come up, being pushed by the spring on
the opposite side of the ring. There is a windage screw on the right-hand side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
of the scope tube circle which adjusts the crosshair ring laterally for windage
adjustments.</p>

<p>The diagram at the left side of Commission's Exhibit 555 shows diagrammatically
the blade spring mounted in the telescope tube which causes the ring
to be pressed against the adjusting screws.</p>

<p>We found in this telescopic sight on this rifle that this ring was shifting in
the telescope tube so that the gun could not be sighted-in merely by changing
the screws. It was necessary to adjust it, and then fire several shots to stabilize
the crosshair ring by causing this spring to press tightly against the screws,
to the point that we decided it would not be feasible to completely sight the
weapon inasfar as windage goes, and in addition found that the elevation
screw could not be adjusted sufficiently to bring the point of impact on the
targets down to the sighting point.</p>

<p>And, therefore, we left the rifle as soon as it became stabilized and fired all
of our shots with the point of impact actually high and to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. As I understand it, the construction of the scope is such that
after the elevation or windage screw has been moved, the scope does not&mdash;is
not&mdash;automatically pushed up by the blade spring as it should be, until you have
fired several shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; that is true&mdash;when the crosshairs are largely out of the
center of the tube. And in this case it is necessary to move the crosshairs completely
up into the upper portion of the tube, which causes this spring to bear
in a position out of the ordinary, and for this windage screw to strike the side
or the sloping surface of the ring rather than at 90 degrees, as it shows in
Exhibit 555. With this screw being off center, both in windage and elevation,
the spring is not strong enough to center the crosshair ring by itself, and it is
necessary to jar it several times, which we did by firing, to bring it to bear
tightly so as to maintain the same position then for the next shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And because of the difficulty you had stabilizing the crosshair,
you did not wish to pursue it to a further refinement, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We sighted the scope in relatively close, fired it, and decided
rather than fire more ammunition through the weapon, we would use these
targets which we had fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, once the crosshairs had been stabilized, did you find that
they stayed, remained stabilized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How long do you think the crosshairs would remain stabilized
in Exhibit 139, assuming no violent jar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. They should remain stabilized continuously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you know when the defect in this scope, which causes you
not to be able to adjust the elevation crosshair in the manner it should be&mdash;do
you know when this defect was introduced into the scope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; I do not. However, on the back end of the scope tube there
is a rather severe scrape which was on this weapon when we received it in the
laboratory, in which some of the metal has been removed, and the scope tube
could have been bent or damaged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you first test the weapon for accuracy on November 27th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you any way of determining whether the defect pre-existed
November 27th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. When we fired on November 27th, the shots were landing high and
slightly to the right. However, the scope was apparently fairly well stabilized
at that time, because three shots would land in an area the size of a dime under
rapid-fire conditions, which would not have occurred if the interior mechanism
of the scope was shifting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But you are unable to say whether&mdash;or are you able to say
whether&mdash;the defect existed before November 27th? That is, precisely when it
was introduced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. As far as to be unable to adjust the scope, actually, I could not
say when it had been introduced. I don't know actually what the cause is. It
may be that the mount has been bent or the crosshair ring shifted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, when you were running, let's say, the last test,
could you have compensated for this defect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; you could take an aiming point low and to the left and
have the shots strike a predetermined point. But it would be no different from
taking these targets and putting an aiming point in the center of the bullet-impact
area. Here that would be the situation you would have&mdash;an aiming
point off to the side and an impact area at the high right corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. If you had been shooting to score bulls-eyes, in a bulls-eye
pattern, what would you have&mdash;what action, if any, would you have taken, to
improve your score?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would have aimed low and to the left&mdash;after finding how high
the bullets were landing; you would compensate by aiming low left, or adjusting
the mount of the scope in a manner which would cause the hairlines to
coincide with the point of impact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How much practice had you had with the rifle before the last
series of four targets were shot by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I had fired it possibly 20 rounds, 15 to 20 rounds, and in addition
had operated the bolt repeatedly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does practice with this weapon&mdash;or would practice with this
weapon&mdash;materially shorten the time in which three shots could be accurately
fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; very definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would practice without actually firing the weapon be helpful&mdash;that
is, a dry-run practice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That would be most helpful, particularly in a bolt-action weapon,
where it is necessary to shift your hand from the trigger area to the bolt, operate
the bolt, and go back to the trigger after closing the bolt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Based on your experience with the weapon, do you think three
shots could be fired accurately within 5½ seconds if no rest was utilized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That would depend on the accuracy which was necessary or
needed or which you desired. I think you could fire the shots in that length
of time, but whether you could place them, say, in a 3- or 4-inch circle without
either resting or possibly using the sling as a support&mdash;I doubt that you could
accomplish that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How&mdash;these targets at which you fired stationary at 100
yards&mdash;how do you think your time would have been affected by use of a moving
target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would have slowed down the shooting. It would have lengthened
the time to the extent of allowing the crosshairs to pass over the moving
target.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you give an amount?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Approximately 1 second. It would depend on how fast the target
was moving, and whether it was moving away from you or towards you or at
right angles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you think you could shorten your time with further practice
with the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you give us an estimate on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I fired three shots in 4.6 seconds at 25 yards with approximately
a 3-inch spread, which is the equivalent of a 12-inch spread at a hundred
yards. And I feel that a 12-inch relative circle could be reduced to 6
inches or even less with considerable practice with the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is in the 4.6-second time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. I would say from 4.8 to 5 seconds, in that area&mdash;4.6
is firing this weapon as fast as the bolt can be operated, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I am now going to ask you several hypothetical questions concerning
the factors which might have affected the aim of the assassin on
November 22d, and I would like you to make the following assumptions in
answering these questions: First, that the assassin fired his shots from the
window near which the cartridges were found&mdash;that is, the easternmost window
on the south face of the sixth floor of the School Book Depository Building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
which is 60 feet above the ground, and several more feet above the position at
which the car was apparently located when the shots were fired.</p>

<p>Second, that the length of the trajectory of the first shot was 175 feet, and
that the length of the trajectory of the third shot was 265 feet.</p>

<p>And third, that the elapsed time between the firing of the first and third shots
was 5½ seconds.</p>

<p>Based on those assumptions, Mr. Frazier, approximately what lead would
the assassin have had to give his target to compensate for its movement&mdash;and
here I would disregard any possible defect in the scope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say he would have to lead approximately 2 feet
under both such situations. The lead would, of course, be dependent upon
the direction in which the object was moving, primarily. If it is moving away
from you, then, of course, the actual lead of, say, 2 feet which he would have
to lead would be interpreted as a considerably less lead in elevation
above the target, because the target will move the 2 feet in a direction away
from the shooter, and the apparent lead then would be cut to one foot or 12
inches or 8 inches or something of that nature, due to the movement of the
individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you made calculations to achieve the figures you gave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I made the calculations, but I don't have them with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you supply these to us, either in further testimony
or by letter, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I have one object here, a diagram which will illustrate that
lead, if you would like to use that. This is drawn to scale from those figures
which you quoted as building height, and distances of 175 feet and 265 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, these figures are approximations of the
figures believed to be involved in the assassination.</p>

<p>Will you supply the data at a later date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I can furnish that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have permission to introduce this as 556?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 556, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you show the lead in that diagram, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. In Commission Exhibit 556, it shows a triangular diagram
with the vertical line on the left-hand side illustrating the height of the building.
The figures of a 60-foot building height <span class="locked">plus&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is height of the muzzle above the ground?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No&mdash;window sill&mdash;60-foot window sill height above the ground,
with an assumed 2-foot height in addition to accommodate the height of the
rifle above the possible&mdash;the possible height of the rifle above the window sill.</p>

<p>The horizontal line extends outward from the building to a small rectangular
block, and then a sloping line illustrates a 5-foot slope from the 175-foot
point to the 265-foot point.</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The time of flight of the bullet of approximately 8/100ths of
a second and, again, it was necessary to assume&mdash;the time of flight of the
bullet from the window to this first location of 175 feet is approximately
8/100ths of a second, which means a 2-foot lead on the target. That is, the
target would move 2 feet in that interval of time, thereby necessitating shooting
slightly ahead of the target to hit your aiming point. That has been diagrammatically
illustrated by a 2-foot distance laid off on this rectangular
block here, and two lines, very fine lines, drawn back towards the window area.</p>

<p>The right-hand side of Commission's 556 shows the same rectangular block,
again with two lines drawn to it, one illustrating the point of aim and the other
the amount of lead which would be necessary to strike an object aimed at which
was moving, according to the time of flight of the projectile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you calculated the speed of the car by translating the
figures on total time elapsed between first and third shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. The time&mdash;the speed of the moving object was calculated
on the basis of an assumed 5.5-second interval for a distance of 90 feet,
which figures out mathematically to be 11.3 miles per hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you said before that in order to give this 2-foot lead,
you would have to aim 2 inches&mdash;for a target going away from you, you would
have to aim 2 inches above the target, or in front of the target.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 2 feet in front of the target, which would interpolate into a
much lower actual elevation change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The elevation change would be 2 inches, is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, no. It would be on the order of 6 to 8 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. 6 to 8 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your 2-inch figure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But it is 6 to 8 inches in elevation?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>Using that telescopic lens, how would you aim that rifle to achieve that
distinction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, it would be necessary to hold the crosshairs an estimated
distance off the target, of say, 6 inches over the intended target, so what when
the shot was fired the crosshairs should be located about 6 inches over your
target, and in the length of time that the bullet was in the air and the length
of time the object was moving, the object would move into actually, the path
of the bullet in approximately 1/10th to 13/100ths of a second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that if the target of the assassin was the center of the
President's head, and he wanted to give a correct lead, where would he have
aimed, if we eliminate the possibility of errors introduced by other factors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He would aim from 4 to 6 inches&mdash;approximately 2 inches, I
would say, above the President's head, which would be actually 6 inches above
his aiming point at the center of the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How difficult is it to give this&mdash;a lead of this size&mdash;to this type
of target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would not be difficult at all with a telescopic sight, because
your target is enlarged four times, and you can estimate very quickly in a
telescopic sight, inches or feet or lead of any desired amount.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would it be substantially easier than it would be with an
open or peep sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. It would be much more difficult to do with the open iron
sights, the notched rear sight and the blade front sight, which is on Exhibit 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you have been able to calculate the precise amount of
lead which should be given, because you have been given figures. If you had
been in the assassin's position, and were attempting to give a correct lead, what
lead do you think you would have estimated as being the necessary lead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would have been a very small amount, in the neighborhood
of a 3-inch lead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. As opposed to the 6 or 8 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. As opposed to about 6 inches, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What would the consequence of the mistake in assumption
as to lead be&mdash;that is, if you gave a 3-inch lead rather than the correct lead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would be a difference of a 3-inch variation in the point of
impact on the target.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, if you had aimed at the center of the President's head,
and given a 3-inch lead, again eliminating other errors, where would you have
hit, if you hit accurately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would be 3 inches below the center of his head&mdash;from the
top&mdash;it would be not the actual center from the back, but the center would be
located high. The bullet would strike at possibly the base of the skull.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, suppose you had given no lead at all and aimed at that
target and aimed accurately. Where would the bullet have hit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would hit the base of the neck&mdash;approximately 6 inches below
the center of the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, would you have tried to give a lead at all, if you
had been in that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. At that range, at that distance, 175 to 265 feet, with this rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
and that telescopic sight, I would not have allowed any lead&mdash;I would not have
made any correction for lead merely to hit a target of that size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>In your experimentation, in your firing of those shots that you have testified
to a little while back, when you fired the first shot, was the shot in the chamber,
or did you have to push it into the chamber by use of the bolt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This was fired with a loaded chamber, and timed from the time
of this first shot until the last shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Did you shoot offhand or did you shoot with a rest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We shot with a rest, both the other individuals and myself,
on each occasion, with one arm resting on a bench or a table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Were you prone, or were you standing up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, we were sitting, actually, sitting or kneeling, in order to
bring the arm down to the rest we were using.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. One other question.</p>

<p>You keep referring to, and the questions kept referring to, "lead." By
"lead," in this instance, you would mean height above the aiming point rather
<span class="locked">than&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. To the right, let's say, of the aiming point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Because it was a going away shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>Where did you conduct these tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The targets were fired both on the indoor range in the FBI range
here in Washington and the 100-yard tests were fired at the Quantico, Va.,
FBI ranges.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Have any tests&mdash;have there been any simulated tests
in the building in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I don't know, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. But the FBI has not conducted any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Not to my knowledge. There may have been measurements
and things of that nature taken, but I don't know.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Now, in these tests, was there any difficulty about
firing this rifle three times within the space or period of time that has been
given to the Commission&mdash;5 seconds, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, let me say this. I fired the rifle three times, in accordance
with that system of timing it from the first shot with the chamber loaded
until the last shot occurred&mdash;three times in 4.6 seconds, 4.8 seconds, 5.6 seconds,
5.8, 5.9, and another one a little over 6, or in that neighborhood. The tenth
of a second variation could very easily be as a result of the timing procedure
used. A reflex of just not stopping the stopwatch in a tenth of a second.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You were firing at a simulated target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. These targets previously introduced, or copies of the targets,
are those which we actually fired.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. My questions are really a followup of the Chairman's
question.</p>

<p>These practices&mdash;were you just practicing for time, or were you practicing
under conditions similar to those existing in Dallas at the time of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The tests we ran were for the purposes of determining whether
we could fire this gun accurately in a limited amount of time, and specifically
to determine whether it could be fired accurately in 6 seconds.</p>

<p>Now, we assumed the 6 seconds empirically&mdash;that is, we had not been furnished
with any particular time interval. Later we were furnished with a
time interval of 5.5 seconds. However, I have no independent knowledge&mdash;had
no independent knowledge of the time interval or the accuracy. But we merely
fired it to demonstrate the results from rapidly firing the weapon, reloading the
gun and so on, in a limited time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Were there other tests conducted to determine the
accuracy of the weapon and so on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir&mdash;only the rapid-fire accuracy tests were fired by the FBI.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. There is no reason to believe that this weapon is
not accurate, is there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is a very accurate weapon. The targets we fired show that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That was the point I was trying to establish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This Exhibit 549 is a target fired, showing that the weapon
will, even under rapid-fire conditions, group closely&mdash;that is, one shot with
the next.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How many shots in the weapon? Five?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The clip takes six itself. You can put a seventh in the chamber.
It could hold seven, in other words. But the clip is only a six-shot clip.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was the weapon fully loaded at the time of the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I don't know how many shells&mdash;three shells were picked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, turning back to the scope, if the elevation crosshair
was defective at the time of the assassination, in the same manner it is
now, and no compensation was made for this defect, how would this have
interacted with the amount of lead which needed to be given to the target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, may I say this first. I do not consider the crosshair as
being defective, but only the adjusting mechanism does not have enough tolerance
to bring the crosshair to the point of impact of the bullet. As to how
that would affect the lead&mdash;the gun, when we first received it in the laboratory
and fired these first targets, shot high and slightly to the right.</p>

<p>If you were shooting at a moving target from a high elevation, relatively high
elevation, moving away from you, it would be necessary for you to shoot over
that object in order for the bullet to strike your intended target, because the
object during the flight of the bullet would move a certain distance.</p>

<p>The fact that the crosshairs are set high would actually compensate for any
lead which had to be taken. So that if you aimed with this weapon as it actually
was received at the laboratory, it would be necessary to take no lead whatsoever
in order to hit the intended object. The scope would accomplish the
lead for you.</p>

<p>I might also say that it also shot slightly to the right, which would tend to cause
you to miss your target slightly to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, on that last question, did you attempt to center the
windage crosshair, to sight-in the windage crosshair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We attempted to, and found that it was changing&mdash;the elevation
was changing the windage. So we merely left the windage as it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you say conclusively that the windage crosshair could
not be centered in, sighted-in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir. I would say that the windage could have been centered
in the telescope to bring the windage to the aiming line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that&mdash;and if that had been done, then you would not have
this problem of dispersion to the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, turning <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Excuse me just a moment. Do you have any opinion
on whether or not the sight was deliberately set that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I do not. And I think I must say here that this mount
was loose on the rifle when we received it. And apparently the scope had even
been taken off of the rifle, in searching for fingerprints on the rifle. So that
actually the way it was sighted-in when we got it does not necessarily mean it
was sighted-in that way when it was abandoned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Carrying this question a little bit further on the deliberateness
of the sighting-in, the problem with the elevation crosshair is built into the
mounting of the scope, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. The mount is not screwed to the rifle in such a fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
that it points the scope at the target closely enough to permit adjusting the
crosshair to accurately sight-in the rifle.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. One other question, then.</p>

<p>It is possible, is it not, to so adjust the telescopic sight to compensate for that
change in the target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes. You can accomplish that merely by putting shims
under the front of the scope and over the back of the scope to tip the scope
in the mount itself, to bring it into alinement.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. So an accomplished person, accustomed to using that
weapon, anticipating a shot of that type, might very well have made such an
adjustment prior to using the rifle; isn't that so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. If it were necessary; yes. There were no shims in the weapon,
either under the mount, where it screws to the weapon, or in the two mounting
rings, when we received it in the laboratory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have any shims with you, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. When we received the weapon yesterday, there were shims
mounted in the rifle. The one under the front end of the mount is in this
envelope.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. But they were not there when you received it originally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir. These were placed there by some other individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, these were placed by the ballistics laboratory
of the Army, a representative of which will testify later.</p>

<p>Now, turning to another possible source of error in aim, Mr. Frazier, if a
rifle such as Exhibit 139 is sighted-in with the use of a target at a given distance,
and it is aimed at a target which is further away or closer than the
target which was used for sighting-in purposes, will any error be introduced by
reason of the fact that the target is further or closer away than the sighting-in
target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it will, because the bullet in leaving the muzzle follows a
curved path rather than a straight path, and in order to hit a specific target
at a specific range, it is necessary for the bullet to travel up and drop down
to the target, rather than have the bore pointed right at the target at the time
of discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you calculate the amount of error which would be introduced
by a specific projectile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you made such calculations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I have taken calculations for similar weight and velocity bullets
from ballistics tables, which bullets approximate the velocity of the 6.5 mm.
bullet and the weight of that bullet as fired from 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are these results affected by the rifle which is employed, or
do they depend upon the missile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. They depend upon the weight and shape of the missile and the
velocity, but not upon the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you give us the results of these calculations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; if you, for instance, take this rifle with a telescopic
sight and sight it in for 300 feet&mdash;that is, the bullet will strike where you
are looking when you are shooting at 300 feet&mdash;at 200 feet the bullet will be
above the line of sight approximately one-quarter of an inch, and at 100 feet it
will be approximately one-quarter of an inch below the line of sight. That is
accomplished because the bullet is still coming up at 100 feet, it crosses the line
of sight, and does not descend again to it until you come to the sighting-in distance
of 300 feet.</p>

<p>If you sighted-in to strike at 450 feet, the bullet at 100 feet would be just
at the line of sight&mdash;that is, on its way up would just cross the line of sight
at about 100 feet. It would be one inch high at 200 feet, and approximately
one and one-eighth inches high at 300 feet.</p>

<p>It would, of course, drop back down to the point of aim at 450 feet. If you
sighted-in at 600 feet, then at 100 feet it would be approximately one-half inch
high. At 200 feet it would be 2 inches high, and at 300 feet it would be approximately
3 inches high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Is this a stationary target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, this is shooting from a rest at a stationary target.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. This is just a <span class="locked">normal&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This is just the trajectory of the bullet.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. As <span class="locked">calculated&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Putting it another way, what would be the drop of the bullet at a
hundred yards if you aim point-blank straight at that target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Assuming no sighting or anything, the bullet would drop about
1.2 inches from the line of the bore at 100 yards.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. 1.2 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. But now the telescopic sight at a hundred yards would
correct that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. Actually, you would sight so that the muzzle is tipped
up slightly with reference to the sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The error would be introduced if you shot at a target which
is closer or further away than the sighting-in target; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you characterize these errors as material?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I would not&mdash;unless you began shooting at distances
well beyond your sighting-in point&mdash;then the amount of variation increases
very rapidly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What would be the usual minimum distance you use for
sighting-in a weapon such as Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would vary from place to place depending upon shooting conditions,
and I would say it would seldom be sighted-in for less than 150 or
200 yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that if the shots involved in the assassination were fired
at 175 feet and 265 feet respectively, they would be shorter than the sighting-in
distance and therefore not materially affected by the trajectory characteristics,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is correct, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, based upon the characteristics of Exhibit 139, and the
ammunition it employs, and based upon your experience with the weapon, would
you consider it to have been a good choice for the commission of a crime such
as the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. Any rifle, regardless of its caliber, would be a good choice
if it would shoot accurately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And did you find this shot accurately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Would you consider the shots difficult shots&mdash;talking
about the shots from the sixth-floor window to the head of the President and to
Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I would not under the circumstances&mdash;a relatively
slow-moving target, and very short distance, and a telescopic sight.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You are not answering that as an expert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. From my own experience in shooting over the years, when you
shoot at 175 feet or 260 feet, which is less than a hundred yards, with a telescopic
sight, you should not have any difficulty in hitting your target.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Putting my question another way, you would not have to
be an expert marksman to accomplish this objective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say no, you certainly would not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And a man is a relatively large target, is he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I would say you would have to be very familiar with
the weapon to fire it rapidly, and do this&mdash;hit this target at those ranges. But
the marksmanship is accomplished by the telescopic sight. I mean it requires
no training at all to shoot a weapon with a telescopic sight once you know that
you must put the crosshairs on the target and that is all that is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How does the recoil of this weapon compare with the recoil
of the average military rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Considerably less. The recoil is nominal with this weapon,
because it has a very low velocity and pressure, and just an average-size
bullet weight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would that trend to improve the shooter's marksmanship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Under rapid-fire conditions, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would that make it a better choice than a more powerfully
recoiling weapon for the type of crime which was committed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. For shooting rapidly, this would be a much better choice, because
the recoil does not throw the muzzle nearly so far off the target, it does
not jar the shooter nearly so much, as a higher-powered rifle, such as a .30/06
or a .270 Winchester, or a German 8 mm. Mauser, for instance, or one of the
other military-type weapons available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is the killing power of the bullets essentially similar to the
killing power at these ranges&mdash;the killing power of the rifles you have named?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How much difference is there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The higher velocity bullets of approximately the same weight
would have more killing power. This has a low velocity, but has very adequate
killing power with reference to humans, because it is a military&mdash;it is an established
military weapon.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. This is a military weapon, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That is designed to kill a human being.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Unless there are further questions on the weapon, I am
going to move into the area of the identification of the cartridge cases and the
bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I may say I have to leave at twelve o'clock for a twelve-fifteen
appointment. I will be back this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, returning to the cartridge cases which were
marked earlier into evidence as Commission Exhibits 543, 544, and 545, and
which, as I stated earlier for the record, had been found next to the window
of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, can you tell us when
you received those cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I received the first of the exhibits, 543 and 544, on
November 23, 1963. They were delivered to me by Special Agent Vincent Drain
of the Dallas FBI Office.</p>

<p>And the other one I received on November 27, 1963, which was delivered
by Special Agents Vincent Drain and Warren De Brueys of the Dallas Office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. After receiving these cartridge cases, did you clean them up
or in any way prepare them for examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. The bases were cleaned of a paint which was placed on
them by the manufacturer. In spots this red lacquer on the base of the case
was overlapping the head of the case where some of the microscopic marks were
located, and some of that color was taken off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why is that lacquer put on the cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It seals the primer area against moisture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Were there any other changes made in the preparation of the
cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You have examined the cartridge cases previously. Are they
in the same condition now that they were when you received them in the
laboratory except for the cleaning of the lacquer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. After receiving the cartridge cases, did you examine them to
determine whether they had been fired in Commission Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When did you make the examinations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. On the dates I mentioned, that is, November 23, 1963, and November
27, 1963.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what were your conclusions, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I found all three of the cartridge cases had been fired in this
particular weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe the examination which you conducted to
reach these conclusions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The first step was to fire test cartridge cases in this rifle to
pick up the microscopic marks which are left on all cartridge cases fired in this
weapon by the face of the bolt. Then those test cartridge cases were mounted
on a comparison microscope, on the right-hand side, and on the left-hand side
of the comparison microscope was mounted one of the three submitted cartridge
cases, so that you could magnify the surfaces of the test and the evidence and
compare the marks left on the cartridge cases by the bolt face and the firing
pin of the rifle.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. McCloy left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I now hand you two cartridge cases, and ask you whether you
can identify these cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; these are the two cartridge cases we fired for test purposes
in Exhibit 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do they have your mark on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, they do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Commissioner Boggs, may I introduce these as 557?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The items referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 557 for identification
and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. These were the only two cartridge cases fired as tests in Exhibit
139&mdash;as tests for the purpose of identification of the cartridge cases which
you examined before, 543, 544, and 545?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; these two were used in those tests. There were many
other cartridge cases fired, but not for that purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain how you are able to come to a conclusion
that a cartridge case was fired in a particular weapon to the exclusion of all
other weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; during the manufacture of a weapon, there are certain
things done to the mechanism of it, which are by machine or by filing, by grinding,
which form the parts of the weapon into their final shape. These machining
and grinding and filing operations will mark the metal with very fine scratches
or turning marks and grinding marks in such a way that there will be developed
on the surface of the metal a characteristic pattern. This pattern, because it is
made by these accidental machine-type operations, will be characteristic of that
particular weapon, and will not be reproduced on separate weapons. It may be
a combination of marks that&mdash;the face of the bolt may be milled, then it may
be in part filed to smooth off the corners, and then, as a final operation, it may
be polished, or otherwise adjusted during the hand fitting operation, so that
it does have its particular pattern of microscopic marks.</p>

<p>The bolt face of the 139 rifle I have photographed and enlarged in this photograph
to show the types of marks I was referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You took this photograph yourself, and it is a photograph of
the bolt face of the 139 rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have this introduced as 558?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 558, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is the magnification of this bolt-face photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Approximately 11 diameters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you slip out the bolt of the rifle so we could see how
it compares, and show us the part of the bolt which is photographed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Orienting the photograph with the writing at the bottom, orients
the bolt also, as it comes out of the rifle&mdash;with the slot shown as a groove on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
bottom of the bolt. Then the extractor on the bolt, is the area shown at the
left side of the photograph, as you view it&mdash;the actual bolt face itself is inset into
the bolt below the surface of the extractor, and a supporting shoulder around it,
and in the center, of course, is the firing-pin hole and the firing pin.</p>

<p>The marks produced during manufacture are the marks seen on the bolt face;
filing marks, machining marks of the various types, even forging marks or casting
marks if the bolt happens to be forged or cast. And then variations which
occur in these marks during the life of the weapon are very important in identification,
because many of the machining marks can be flattened out, can be
changed, by merely a grain of sand between the face of the cartridge case and the
bolt at the time a shot is fired, which will itself scratch and dent the bolt face.
So the bolt face will pick up a characteristic pattern of marks which are
peculiar to it.</p>

<p>The same is true of extractors and ejectors. They are in turn machined and
will have a pattern of marks or scratches on their surfaces which will mark
cartridge cases in the same manner each time.</p>

<p>The comparison we made was of the marks appearing in this photograph,
558, in fairly close proximity to the firing pin hole, since that is the area
that the primer in the head of the cartridge case comes in contact with.</p>

<p>The primer in a cartridge case normally takes marks more readily than the
surrounding brass portion of the cartridge case, which is a considerably harder
metal and is not impressed with these marks as readily.</p>

<p>The three cartridge cases, 553, 554, and 555, were <span class="locked">compared&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that 543, 544, and 545?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I am sorry&mdash;yes, 543, 544, and 545. These three cartridge
cases were placed one at a time on the comparison microscope, and the surfaces
having the breech-face marks or the bolt marks were compared with those on the
test cartridge cases, Exhibit 557. As a result of comparing the pattern of
microscopic markings on the test cartridge cases and those marks on Exhibits
543, 544, and 545, both of the face of the bolt and the firing pin, I concluded
that these three had been fired in this particular weapon.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Who manufactured these cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Western Cartridge Co., East Alton, Ill.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. They manufacture cartridges and bullets for all manner
of rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, they do.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. This is not&mdash;this rifle is not common in the United
States, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is fairly common now, but at the time it was manufactured
or used primarily it was not. It was imported into this country as surplus
military equipment, and has been advertised quite widely.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. These three cartridge&mdash;these three shells that you
had were the same as the live ones that were found there, were they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There was one live cartridge found. They are identical.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And the live one was manufactured also <span class="locked">by&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, the Western Cartridge Co. It bears the head stamp "WCO"
and "6.5. mm."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. These are not difficult to obtain? You can buy them
anywhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, you can buy them from mail-order houses primarily, or
a few gun shops that have accumulated a supply by ordering them. The information
we have is that two million rounds were imported into the United
States in one lot, one shipment&mdash;and they have been transmitted over the country
and are for sale by several different surplus gun shops&mdash;used guns&mdash;mail-order
houses and places of that nature&mdash;and gunsmiths, and firearms shops sell this
ammunition.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, what is the basis of the statement you made
earlier that no two bolt faces would be the same?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Because the marks which are placed on any bolt face are accidental
in nature. That is, they are not placed there intentionally in the first
place. They are residual to some machining operation, such as a milling machine,
in which each cutter of the milling tool cuts away a portion of the metal;
then the next tooth comes along and cuts away a little more, and so on, until
the final surface bears the combination of the various teeth of the milling
cutter. In following that operation, then, the surface is additionally scratched&mdash;until
you have numerous&mdash;we call them microscopic characteristics, a characteristic
being a mark which is peculiar to a certain place on the bolt face, and
of a certain shape, it is of a certain size, it has a certain contour, it may be
just a little dimple in the metal, or a spot of rust at one time on the face of the
bolt, or have occurred from some accidental means such as dropping the bolt,
or repeated use having flattened or smoothed off the surface of the metal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why doesn't a series of the same machines, or repeated use
of the same machines, cause the same results, apart from future accidental
markings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. In some instances a certain type of cutter will duplicate a certain
pattern of marks. In general you will find for a milling cutter a circular
mark. And you may find the same pattern of circles. But that milling cutter
does not actually cut the steel; it tears it out, it chips it out, and the surface of
the metal then is rough&mdash;even though the circle is there, the circle is not a
smooth circle, but it is a result of tearing out the metal, and you will have
a very rough surface. When magnified sufficiently, you can detect the difference
even between two similarly milled surfaces because of the minor variations in
the cutting operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you had occasion to examine such similarly-milled
surfaces?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes; many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you go into detail on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, part of my work in the laboratory is dealing with tool-marks
of all types, from drills, mills, files, cutting instruments, and so on. And
when you are dealing with filing marks or milling marks and so on, it is sometimes
possible to identify a particular mill as having made a certain mark on
the basis of the grinding marks on that particular mill. But such as a case
like this, where the cutting marks have now been altered through use of the
weapon and corrosion, or in wear or in filing, some of the original marks are
removed, and other marks are in their place, until eventually you reach a condition
where that bolt face will be entirely different from any other bolt face.
It is a matter actually&mdash;when you get down to the basis of it, it is a matter of
a mathematical impossibility in the realm of human experience for any two
things to ever be exactly alike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is because the original markings will not be exactly
alike, and then you have added accidental markings on top of the original ones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Returning for a moment to the original markings, as I understand
it, you have worked with the tools themselves and the impressions the
tools themselves leave, as opposed to a tooled surface, such as this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I have worked with both. In other words, in comparing tool-marks,
you examine not only the tool, but the marks they produce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And in working with these tools, as I understand your testimony,
you have found that the markings which a tool leaves, which the same tool
leaves, will be distinctive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is true, yes. When it is a scrape or an impression from
its surface, or something of that nature, it can be very readily identified. But
if it is a drill or something of that nature, where you have a tearing operation,
then it is not readily identified, but it occasionally can be identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, how many such examinations do you think you have
made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Thousands of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you noticed whether the marks left by a given tool&mdash;that
you have examined&mdash;change over the course of the use of the tool?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, they change very rapidly when a tool is used to cut a hard
object.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you elaborate on what you mean by "very rapidly"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, for instance, when using a pry bar, for example, one
insertion of a pry bar into the hard insulation of a safe, with pressure applied
to it can change the entire blade of the tool to the extent that you could not
identify a succession of marks, because of the abrasion by the insulation. But
that same tool, used to mark a soft steel or brass or copper, could make mark
after mark without changing, or only a small portion of it may change with
each impression. Or it may gradually change over a period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, is the metal in the bolt face a hard metal or a soft
metal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say it was hard <span class="locked">metal&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. With reference to copper or other softer metals&mdash;it is a steel.
I could not say how hard it actually is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What will the effect of the metal used in the bolt face be
upon the tool which is used to finish it off, cut it and finish it off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The tool will gradually wear out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, will the tool leave different marks on the end of the
bolt face from one bolt to the very next bolt face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes; that very often happens. The tool is worn out or the
small cuttings get underneath the edge, between the tool, and nick the edge of
the tool, so that the tool will gradually change over a period of time. The cutting
edge&mdash;the amount of change depends upon the amount of wear, the heat involved,
and the hardness of the metal&mdash;the relative hardness of the metal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Will that particular change be noticed invariably in two
consecutive bolt faces?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So what is the genesis of the difference in the two consecutive
bolt faces as they come from the manufacturer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The change, as I said, depends on the bolt you are using. It
does not always take place, because some bolts are made of a very soft metal,
and they will not necessarily change a machining tool to that extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But the markings, you said, would be different on two consecutive
bolt faces?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And if the tool is not changed, what is the origin of the difference
between the markings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There are other accidental markings placed there during the
machining operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you describe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. For instance, as the blade of a milling machine travels around
a surface, it takes off actually a dust&mdash;it is not actually a piece of metal&mdash;it
scrapes a little steel off in the form of a dust&mdash;or a very fine powder or
chip&mdash;that tooth leaves a certain pattern of marks&mdash;that edge. That milling
cutter may have a dozen of these edges on its surface, and each one takes
a little more. Gradually you wear the metal down, you tear it out actually
until you are at the proper depth. Those little pieces of metal, as they are
traveling around, can also scratch the face of the bolt&mdash;unless they are washed
away. So that you may have accidental marks from that source, just in the
machining operation.</p>

<p>Now, there are two types of marks produced in a cutting operation. One,
from the nicks along the cutting edge of the tool, which are produced by a
circular operating tool&mdash;which produce very fine scratches in a circular pattern.
Each time the tool goes around, it erases those marks that were there before.
And when the tool is finally lifted out, you have a series of marks which go
around the surface which has been machined, and you will find that that pattern
of marks, as this tool goes around, will change. In one area, it will be one set
of marks&mdash;and as you visually examine the surface of the metal, these very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
fine marks will extend for a short distance, then disappear, and a new mark
of a new type will begin and extend for a short distance. The entire surface,
then, will have a&mdash;be composed of a series of circles, but the individual marks
seen in the microscope will not be circular, will not form complete circles
around the face of the bolt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you had occasion to examine two consecutive bolt
faces from a factory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what did you find on that examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There would be no similarity in the individual microscopic
characteristics between the two bolt faces.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. There actually was none?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, there was none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In the bolt face with which we are dealing, Exhibit 139, can
you say from inspection whether the markings on that bolt face are predominantly
the accidental markings introduced subsequent to manufacture,
or the markings of the manufacture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say that these were filing marks for the most part
which were made during manufacture, some of which have been obliterated and
changed through use&mdash;possibly corrosion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, taking Exhibit 543, did you prepare a photograph
of this <span class="locked">exhibit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Compared with the test cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; this is the photograph, showing the test cartridge
case from Exhibit 557 on the right and the cartridge case 543 on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This was prepared by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The item referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 559 and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, that is marked on the left C-14, and on the right,
C-6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the left-hand photograph is a photograph of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Of the cartridge case 543.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is the actual fired case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it shows just a portion of the primer, and a very
small portion of the firing-pin impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the right-hand side of that photograph, marked C-6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is a test cartridge case, fired in the rifle Exhibit 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is the magnification, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Approximately 100 diameters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And is that magnification equal on both sides of the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you make your identification of Exhibit 543, that is the
identification of that exhibit as having been fired in the rifle 139, on the basis
of your examination under the microscope, or on the basis of the photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Under the microscope. The photograph has no relationship
whatsoever to the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The examination is made microscopically through the use
of your eyes, and your eyes will record depths and shapes to a much greater
extent than can be shown in a photograph. So that the examination and
comparison is made of these irregular surfaces mentally, rather than mechanically
by any means. The photograph is taken primarily to illustrate
the types of marks found and their location, relatively, on the specimen.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. We will have to adjourn and come back at 2.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:15 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT A. FRAZIER RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2:10 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You are still under oath, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I would like to begin by clearing up a few items which have
been covered or left open during the morning session.</p>

<p>First, you were going to supply us with certain figures concerning the times
which were taken by two of the Agents to fire three shots in the first series of
tests which were made for determining the accuracy of the firing under rapid-fire
conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; that was at two targets. The first one I gave you&mdash;Killion
fired in 9 seconds. The other was a target marked Cunningham and
Frazier. Cunningham fired his three shots in 8 seconds and I fired my three
shots in 5.9 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now also you had made certain calculations concerning what
we have been calling the lead that had to be given to a target, assuming various
factors which were supplied to you. Do you have those calculations now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; the lead would amount to shooting over the target
at 175 feet, a distance of 6.7 inches, and the decimal on that figure is not an
accurate decimal because this figure relates to an average velocity of ammunition
of this type, and is concerned with a speed of a vehicle which is also estimated,
and a distance which may or may not be exactly accurate.</p>

<p>But at a ground speed of 11 miles an hour, it would be necessary to shoot over
or lead a target 6.7 inches for the bullet to hit the intended spot on the target.
At 265 feet the lead would be .51 feet, or 6.1 inches.</p>

<p>I might say that the variation, that of less lead at the longer distance,
is in great part due to the fact that the target is farther away and that the shot
is more nearly in line with the direction in which the target is moving, which
would account for much of the drop in the amount of lead.</p>

<p>And, in addition, I calculated this on the basis of the fact that there was a
slight slope between the 175-foot and the 265-foot location downwards away from
the shooter, which would also tend to more nearly cause the target to be moving
in the same path as the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And did you convert those lead distances into the amount of
inches which the shooter would have to sight above the head, above the point
of the target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Those figures I gave were the elevations or the sighting distances
above the target. The 6.7 inches vertical lead or sighting over the target is the
equivalent of leading on the ground of 1.4 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that table also shows leads at other car speeds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This table&mdash;I could calculate them&mdash;it only shows miles per hour
translated into feet per second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I mean, does it show various miles per hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it shows miles per hour in feet per second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Without going into detail at this time, may I have permission
to introduce this table into evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This will be Commission Exhibit 560.</p>

<p>(The item identified as Commission Exhibit No. 560 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Frazier, in the construction of this table and also
in your last tests for rapid fire for this rifle, you used a five-and-a-half second
figure as a factor in your calculations, and in your attempt at rapid fire accuracy
placements. Can you give us the source of that figure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. You were the source of it, based on examination, as
I understood it, of a movie taken at the scene, and measurements taken at the
scene. However, I have no knowledge of the actual time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, I just wanted to establish that this is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
source that was supplied by the Commission and which is tentative, and it
is not to imply any final conclusion on the part of the FBI; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I hope it is taken that way, because we don't know what the
time actually was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Another point then, which should have been covered this
morning, Mr. Frazier, in your qualifications: have you testified before in court?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you estimate the number of times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Approximately 400 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Finally, we had discussed briefly your examination of consecutively
manufactured bolt faces to see whether any two such consecutively
manufactured bolt faces were identical in their microscopic characteristics.
How many such examinations have you performed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say about four examinations of pairs of bolt faces
which have been consecutively manufactured.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And in each case the result was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The marks on one bolt face in no way resembled the marks on
the other bolt face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, we were just beginning to discuss, before the
recess, Commission Exhibit 559, which is a picture, as you described it, of Exhibit
No. 543 and a test cartridge under a microscope, and that is also known
as C-6 and C-14, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you discuss, by using that picture, some of the markings
which you have seen under the microscope and on the basis of which you made
your identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. In the photograph I have drawn some small circles
and numbered them, those circles, correspondingly on each side of the photograph.
The purpose of the circles is not to point out all the similarities, but to call attention
to some of them and to help orient in locating a mark on one with a
mark on the opposite side of the photograph. In general the area shown is immediately
outside of the firing pin in the bolt of the 139 rifle, on the left side
of the photograph, and Commission Exhibit 543 on the right side.</p>

<p>The circles have been drawn around the dents or irregularly shaped ridges,
small bumps, and depressions on the surface of the metal in six places on each
side of the photograph. It is an examination of these marks, and all of the
marks on the face of the breech, microscopically which permits a conclusion to be
reached. The photograph itself actually is a substitute to show only the type of
marks found rather than their nature, that is, their height, their width, or their
relationship to each other, which is actually a mental, visual, comparison on the
two specimens themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Referring for a second to this mental, visual, comparison, Mr.
Frazier, would a person without firearms training&mdash;firearms-identification training&mdash;be
able to look under a microscope and make a determination for himself
concerning whether a given cartridge case had been fired in a given weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. In that connection that person could look through the microscope.
He may or may not see these individual characteristics which are present,
because he does not know what to look for in the first place, and, secondly, they
are of such a nature that you have to mentally sort them out in your mind going
back and forth between one area and the other until you form a mental picture
of them in a comparison such as this.</p>

<p>If it was a different type of comparison, of parallel marks or something of
that nature, then he could see the marks, but in either instance, without having
compared hundreds and hundreds of specimens, he would not be able to make
any statement as to whether or not they were fired from the same rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you say that this is, then, a matter of expert interpretation
rather than a point-for-point comparison which a layman could make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say so; yes. I don't think a layman would recognize
some of the things on these cartridge cases and some shown in the photographs
as actually being significant or not significant, because there will be things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
present which have nothing whatsoever to do with the firing of the cartridge
case in the gun.</p>

<p>There may be a depression in the primer to begin with, and there are no
marks registered at that point as a result of the firing. Unless these things are
known to occur, someone may actually arrive at a different conclusion, because
of the absence of similar marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now having reference to the specific exhibit before you, which
is <span class="locked">559&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are all the marks shown in both photographs identical?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And could you go into detail on a mark which is not identical
to explain why you would get such a result?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, for instance, between what I have drawn here as circle
4 and circle 5, there is a slanting line from the upper left to the lower right on
C-6. This line shows as a white line in the photograph.</p>

<p>On the other side there is a rough, very rough ridge which runs through there,
having an entirely different appearance from the relatively sharp line on C-6.
The significant part of that mark is the groove in between, rather than the sharp
edge of the mark, because the sharp corner could be affected by the hardness
of the metal or the irregular surface of the primer and the amount of pressure
exerted against it, pressing it back against the face of the bolt, at the time the
cartridges were fired. So that you would never expect all the marks on one
cartridge case to be identical with all the marks on the other cartridge case.</p>

<p>In fact, you would expect many differences. But the comparison is made on
the overall pattern, contour, and nature of the marks that are present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. Frazier, could you discuss or characterize those points which you have
circled on Commission Exhibit 559, starting from the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Number 1 circle is drawn around a depression in the metal of
irregular shape. I might say that number 1 shows on the right side of the
photograph, and only half of it shows on the left side because of the relative
position of the two cartridge cases in the photograph.</p>

<p>Number 2 is a circle drawn around a long line which extends obliquely across
each cartridge case from the upper left to the lower right. The long line itself
is a means of orienting the cartridge cases one with the other, but the circle
is drawn around a break in that line in the form of a very small hump or an
absence of metal which shows up as an actual break in the long line.</p>

<p>Number 3 again is a depression between two grooves, which is rather similar in
shape. I cannot tell you how deep it is because the photograph only shows
two dimensions. But on the cartridge cases it has a very characteristic depth
to it, which is readily apparent.</p>

<p>It is formed by two parallel lines extending from the upper left to the lower,
towards the lower right, with the depression in between, and again one side of
the depression is formed by a small raised area in the primer metal which is
seen in each photograph as a conical, almost a conical-shaped bump or raised
area.</p>

<p>Number 4 is another raised portion on the photograph. In connection with 4,
I would like to point out that a portion of this bump has been erased from the
test cartridge case on the left-hand side of the photograph, the erasure caused
by the turning of the bolt of the weapon while being pressed against the primer,
which has smoothed off some of the protruding rough areas on the primer.</p>

<p>Number 5 is a horizontal ridge which has two depressions, one on the top
and one on the bottom, shown on both sides of the photograph, and number 6
is a wishbone type of ridge, a wide ridge which divides into two smaller ridges
on the left-hand edge, and in the middle of the dividing lines, the forked lines,
is a small dent or raised portion. Those six which I have marked are only
portions of those shown in the photograph, and of course the photograph does
not show the entire surface of the primer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Were you able to find identifying marks on the brass as well
as the primer on this cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; I did not notice any marks on the brass portions outside
of the primer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that typical of cartridge-case identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Generally that is true, unless there is a great pressure, unless
the brass of the cartridge case is soft, or unless the marks are very sharp on
the breech face; then they will be impressed into the brass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This picture represents only a portion of the primer. You
examined the entire primer to make your identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would not have been necessary to examine the entire primer
necessarily, but of course we do examine the entire primer, pick out all of
the marks on the left and the right, and rotate the cartridge cases and look
at them from various angles, before arriving at a conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you amplify the meaning of the statement that it would
not be necessary to examine the entire primer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There are sufficient marks shown in this photograph upon
which to base an identification. In other words, it would not be necessary
to have the rest of the primer if it had been mutilated or destroyed or something
of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you also examine the firing-pin impression in the
cartridge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take a picture of that examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. Here is the photograph of the firing-pin impression, again
on the left the rifle, and on the right the cartridge case, Commission's 543.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That bears the number C-14 and C-6, corresponding to the
numbers on Commission Exhibit 559?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take this photograph or have it taken under your
supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is the magnification of this photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 90 diameters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is it equal on both sides?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this admitted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be 561.</p>

<p>(The item identified as Commission Exhibit No. 561 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you proceed with the discussion of the circled marks
on this photograph, number 561?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. In the case of firing-pin impressions which are shown on
Exhibit 561, the marks result from two related sources; excuse me, not sources,
but from two related causes, one being the force given to the firing pin driving
it into the primer to set off the cartridge, and the second being the force of
the powder charge inside the cartridge being driven back&mdash;driving the primer
back against the firing pin at the same time, so that the metal of the primer
is caused to flow or be stamped by the firing pin and pressed against by the
gases, so that any irregularities in the firing pin will be impressed into the
primer of the cartridge case.</p>

<p>Number 1 consists of a double horizontal line, one a fairly wide coarse line
at the top. Immediately under that approximately one-eighth of an inch is a
fairly fine horizontal line.</p>

<p>Circled and marked number 2 is a very coarse, wide ridge, very short in
length, approximately one-half an inch, and an eighth to a quarter of an inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
in height. This ridge is formed by two grooves, a straight groove across the
top, and a curved or crescent-shaped groove across the bottom.</p>

<p>Number 3 is a circle drawn around two small raised areas in the primer
metal separated by a depression.</p>

<p>Number 4 is a section from a large ridge across the metal of the primer,
which has a break in its surface in the lower portion of the circle, and immediately
above the break is a groove, and immediately above that again is another
ridge which is at a little steeper angle upwards to the left.</p>

<p>Number 5 is a depression, is a portion of a depression appearing at the bottom
of the circle with a very short ridge running horizontally across the circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again there are dissimilar marks on these two pictures, Mr.
Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; there are, for the same reason, that metal does not flow
the same in every instance, and it will not be impressed to the same depth and
to the same amount, depending on the type of metal, the blow that is struck,
and the pressures involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is your identification made therefore on the basis of the
presence of similarities, as opposed to the absence of dissimilarities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, that is not exactly right. The identification is made on the
presence of sufficient individual microscopic characteristics so that a very definite
pattern is formed and visualized on the two surfaces.</p>

<p>Dissimilarities may or may not be present, depending on whether there have
been changes to the firing pin through use or wear, whether the metal flows are
the same, and whether the pressures are the same or not.</p>

<p>So I don't think we can say that it is an absence of dissimilarities, but rather
the presence of similarities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Any further questions on this cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, you have testified also that you identified the
cartridge case which is Exhibit 544 as having been fired from this rifle, in this
rifle, to the exclusion of all others. Did you take a photograph of the comparison
that you made under the microscope of number 544?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. I again took two photographs, one of the breech-face or
bolt-face marks, and one of the firing-pin marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This exhibit which I am holding is a picture of the breech-face
marks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And was that taken by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the magnification here is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 90 diameters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have this admitted, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be number 562, Mr. Reporter.</p>

<p>(The item described as Commission Exhibit No. 562 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you discuss the markings on this picture, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. In Commission Exhibit 562, there is again the vertical
dividing line which is the top of the prism in the microscope which divides your
view. On the left hand side is a portion of the primer and a portion of the head
of the test cartridge case from Exhibit 139. On the right side of the photograph
is a portion of the surface of the primer and a portion of the firing-pin impression
of the cartridge case, Commission Exhibit 544.</p>

<p>To assist in pointing out on the photograph some of the areas where individual
microscopic characteristics are present, I have had circles drawn, circling at
the top, number 1, an oval-shaped depression in the metal, having an irregularly
shaped or wavy ridge across the bottom of the circle. Immediately below that is
another ridge which has a flat top, and is more or less of a diamond shape.</p>

<p>Number 3 circle is over a very coarse, wide ridge separated by two fairly
deep grooves on each side.</p>

<p>Number 4 circle is over a conical-shaped raised portion on the primer which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
represents a dent in the metal of the bolt face, and number 5 again is a raised
area on the primer which is a portion of a ridge. In this instance this is more
or less of a compound ridge which runs horizontally with a small break in it
pointing down toward the lower left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Is that same break apparent in the left hand photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it is. Looking very closely and right at the hairline,
you can see the break in the ridge where it forms more or less of a <span class="sym">Y</span>. The
actual connecting point is not present, but you can see the portion of the ridge
as it heads towards the horizontal ridge. The hairline has separated that
portion of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you call these marks strongly characteristic marks,
Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes; very characteristic. They are primarily characteristic
because of their irregular shape. If they had been regular in shape, it wouldn't
have meant nearly as much as it does to have the irregular rough surfaces and
contours of the marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I think you have identified the next picture I am holding
as having been taken by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it was. That is a 70-diameter magnification photograph
of Exhibit 544 on the right, and the test from the rifle on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And this bears the numbers C-14 and C-7, and is a firing-pin
photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May this firing-pin mark photograph be admitted, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is 563.</p>

<p>(The item was numbered 563, and was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you review that photograph, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. In Exhibit 563 the test cartridge case representing
the rifle is on the left side of the photograph, and shows most of the firing-pin
impression in that cartridge case. Five circles have been drawn over towards
the right-hand edge of the firing-pin impression, and five similarly located circles
have been drawn over the area at the right-hand edge of the firing-pin impression
of Exhibit 544.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which is actually the left-hand side of the right-hand part
of the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would be&mdash;that is right; at the dividing line, the circles on
544 are drawn close to the dividing line, which shows only a very small portion
of the firing pin of that cartridge case.</p>

<p>Beginning with number 1, it has a gently sloping ridge running from upper
left toward lower right in each instance, with a break in the ridge contour at
the middle in the form of an extension upwards toward the top of the photograph.</p>

<p>In number 2 there is a circle drawn around the end of a very long line in
the left-hand side of the photograph. The circle is drawn to show a <span class="sym">Y</span>-shaped
break in this line located on both cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Number 3 is a photograph of an irregular-shaped raised portion on the firing-pin
impression, which is very difficult to describe in words.</p>

<p>Number 4 is a groove extending from upper right to lower left which has a
break in its lower side to allow a horizontal groove to come in towards the
main groove. The lower portion of that groove coming in from the lower side
is in the form of a crescent-shaped ridge, which starts horizontally from the
left and then falls off towards the lower right-hand side of the photograph.</p>

<p>The circle, number 5, is again a <span class="sym">Y</span>-shaped or wishbone-shaped ridge, with a
horizontal bar on the right, and then extending ridges upward toward the
left and downward to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again, are these firing-pin marks what you would call strongly
characteristic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I would say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does the firing pin give any evidence of having been altered
subsequent to the original manufacture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; only in an accidental sort of way, that is, very fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
scratches which may have been caused by firing or dirt on a cartridge or
something which may have scratched the firing pin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are firing-pin marks usually as characteristic of a given
cartridge case as the primer marks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I would say they are as characteristic. However, they
may not always be as evident, they may not be seen as readily. However, they
are just as characteristic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Just to repeat again, what is this side of this picture? What
does this represent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That represents the rifle cartridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The rifle cartridge itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And this on the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This is one of the three cartridge cases recovered from the
building, Exhibit 544.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, you fired two test cartridges in the rifle, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We fired several test cartridge cases. These two are the ones
that were used in the comparisons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you fire several for possible comparison purposes, or
only two for possible comparison purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Those we fired were in the time-fire test and we retained some
of those for possible use in comparing, but it was not necessary to use them,
actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you use both of these test cartridge cases in the photographs,
or only one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I could not tell by these photographs. We did not make any
distinction when we were comparing tests with the evidence as to which test
cartridge case we were using.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you made your selection among cartridge cases to
select the items which would be used as test cases for comparison purposes,
were the items you rejected much different from those you selected?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No. The marks were generally the same on all of them. Those
we used in this comparison were two tests which we fired on November 23d and
used them in our tests&mdash;made our examination, our identification.</p>

<p>Later on we fired accuracy tests and speed tests and retained some of those
cartridge cases, but they were not necessarily retained for test purposes, for
identification of the weapon, but merely as a result of the other tests that were
made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you just as easily have used other of the items from
your original November <span class="locked">twenty&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Getting to the last cartridge case, Exhibit 545, did you take
a photograph of the exhibit together with the test case under the microscope
after making your identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I did. This photograph shows that cartridge case 545 on
the right, and the test cartridge case from the rifle, 139, on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This is marked on the right C-38 and on the left C-14?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again this is a photograph taken by you or under your
supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that is of the primer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you have a second photograph here also, marked C-14
and C-38, also taken by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And this is of the markings of the firing pin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give us the magnification first of the primer-markings
photograph?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is 100 diameters enlargement on the primer, and on
the firing-pin it is 80 diameters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now in all the cases of the photographs you have given us,
the magnifications are equal on both sides, are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have these admitted into evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. They will be 564 and 565.</p>

<p>(The items, identified as Commission Exhibits Nos. 564 and 565, were received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you discuss the photograph, Exhibit 564 please, Mr.
Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Exhibit 564 is again, a portion of the primer of the cartridge
case fired by me in the rifle number 139 appearing on the left side of the vertical
dividing line through the center of the photograph, and on the right side a portion
of the surface of the cartridge case, Exhibit 545, showing its primer and
the marks on it.</p>

<p>In the photograph four circles, or portions of circles, have been drawn, circling
some of the areas where individual microscopic characteristics are found which
permitted identifying the two cartridge cases as having been fired in the same
weapon.</p>

<p>In the upper circle are again two ridges separated by a groove, the lower
right-hand end of which is blocked by a raised portion in the metal of the
primer.</p>

<p>Circle number 2 is again a depression bounded on the top by a long sloping
groove, sloping from the upper left subsequently to the lower right.</p>

<p>In circle number 3 there is a series of ridges running horizontally across the
photograph. The lowest of these three ridges is a rather wide round-topped
ridge.</p>

<p>Circle number 4 shows the left-hand side of a figure which you could roughly
call a Z in the primer, which consists of a horizontal or nearly horizontal
line running from left to right which meets a second line running from right
down to the left, which again meets a third line which runs from the left
to the right. This is shown in both photographs as the three lines which form the
shape of a Z on the primer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, on this photograph there is shown a mark at
approximately 3 o'clock on the left-hand side of the picture, and 9 o'clock on
the right-hand side, and the marks seem to be different in the two pictures,
being broader on the left-hand, C-14, than on the right, C-38. Could you
explain the genesis of the difference? It seems to extend further down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Approximately in the center of the photograph where the two
images meet, there is a scraped area which is the result of the surface of the
metal of the bolt scraping the surface of the primer as the bolt was turned
in opening the bolt to extract the cartridge.</p>

<p>On the test cartridge case, this area is much broader and coarser because the
bolt was pressing more tightly against the primer when it was turned. On the
evidence cartridge case, the marks are relatively fine, separated, and even
show portions of the surface of the primer in between the circular marks left
by the rotating bolt. The reason is that this primer was not being pressed
as tightly against the bolt at the time it was turned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would that be due to differences in the construction of the
cartridge&mdash;the two cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It could be differences in the cartridge, but primarily it would
be a difference in the amount of setback of the cartridge against the bolt at
the time it was fired.</p>

<p>If a cartridge is slightly away from the bolt when it is fired, the primer
is blown back out of the cartridge. As the pressure builds up, the cartridge
then moves back and reseats the primer in the primer pocket. The manner in
which that movement of the primer out and back in is accomplished determines
how tightly the primer will bear against the face of the breach after the
cartridge has been fired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
It could be that, and it could be just a slight difference in the hardness of
the metal of the primer which caused this one to flow back more and be marked
more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you discuss Exhibit No. 565?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; in Commission Exhibit No. 565 is shown the firing-pin
impressions of the test cartridge case from the 139 rifle on the left and the
cartridge case, 545, on the right, with a dividing line through the middle
separating the primer of one cartridge case from the primer of the other.</p>

<p>No circles have been drawn around this photograph because the marks
shown are marks of an abraded area on the firing pin, and are more or less
parallel and formed parallel patterns, so that the eye can follow from one line
across to the opposite side of the photograph.</p>

<p>In this area shown of the firing pin of the weapon, there was a small scraped
area which left these microscopic ridges and grooves shown on the left photograph,
and also reproduced in the 545 primer or firing-pin impression on the right
side of the photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. State for me again what is on the left side? What is this
C-14?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This is the rifle cartridge case, the test cartridge case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The test rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; the cartridge case which I fired in 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. In 139. And the one on the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This the cartridge case from the building, Exhibit 545.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Which was found in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Found in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. On all of these on the left is it always the <span class="locked">same&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; on all of the photographs we have discussed so far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I just wanted to make that clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, it appears to the eye that only a portion of this
is in focus. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Only a portion of the entire photograph is in focus, yes, and
that is the area where these individual marks appear, occur.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; the reason being the outer area, the area up to
the edge of the firing-pin impression is considerably higher, and the microscope
does not have the depth of focus to focus on a very deep groove or depression
such as the firing pin at the bottom of it and still maintain the top in focus.</p>

<p>The firing pin is circular, I should say, hemispherical in shape, so that it
leaves a cup-shaped impression of it&mdash;only one portion of it can be in focus
at the same time; the other part being either higher or lower will be out of
focus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, I now hand you Commission Exhibit 399, which,
for the record, is a bullet, and also for the record, it is a bullet which was
found in the Parkland Hospital following the assassination. Are you familiar
with this exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. This is a bullet which was delivered to me in the
FBI laboratory on November 22, 1963 by Special Agent Elmer Todd of the
FBI Washington Field Office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does that have your mark on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The bullet is in the same condition as it was when you received
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; except for the marking of my initials and the other
examiners. There is a discoloration at the nose caused apparently by mounting
this bullet in some material which stained it, which was not present when
received, and one more thing on the nose is a small dent or scraped area.
At this area the spectographic examiner removed a small quantity of metal for
analysis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you prepare the bullet in any way for examination?
That is, did you clean it or in any way alter it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; it was not necessary. The bullet was clean and it
was not necessary to change it in any way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. There was no blood or similar material on the bullet when
you received it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Not any which would interfere with the examination, no, sir.
Now there may have been slight traces which could have been removed just
in ordinary handling, but it wasn't necessary to actually clean blood or tissue
off of the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you examine this exhibit to determine whether it had
been fired in Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was. Exhibit 399 was fired in the rifle 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is to the exclusion of all other rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe the types of markings which are generated
onto a bullet, as opposed to those which are generated onto a cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. A bullet when it is fired picks up the marks of the barrel of the
weapon. These marks consist of rifling marks of the lands and the grooves,
the spiral grooves in the barrel, and, in addition, the abrasion marks or rubbing
marks which the bullet picks up due to the friction between the barrel and
the surface of the copper jacket on the bullet, or if it is a lead bullet, with the
lead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You said the marks of the groove. You mean the marks of
the groove or the marks of the lands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Both, sir; both are present. In this barrel there are four lands
and four grooves. Each of the raised portions in the barrel will be impressed
into the surface of the bullet causing four&mdash;we call them land impressions&mdash;on
the bullet, and, in between, four groove impressions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How are you able to conclude that a given bullet was fired
in a given weapon to the exclusion of all other weapons, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is based again upon the microscopic marks left on the
fired bullets and those marks in turn are based upon the barrel from which
the bullets are fired.</p>

<p>The marks in the barrel originate during manufacture. They originate
through use of the gun, through accidental marks resulting from cleaning,
excessive cleaning, of the weapon, or faulty cleaning.</p>

<p>They result from corrosion in the barrel due to the hot gases and possibly
corrosive primer mixtures in the cartridges used, and primarily again they
result from wear, that is an eroding of the barrel through friction due to
the firing of cartridges, bullets through it.</p>

<p>In this particular barrel the manufacturer's marks are caused by the drill
which drills out the barrel, leaving certain marks from the drilling tool.
Then portions of these marks are erased by a rifling tool which cuts the four
spiral grooves in the barrel and, in turn, leaves marks themselves, and in
connection with those marks of course, the drilling marks, being circular
in shape, there is a tearing away of the surface of the metal, so that a microscopically
rough surface is left.</p>

<p>Then removing part of those marks with a separate tool causes that barrel
to assume an individual characteristic, a character all of its own.</p>

<p>In other words, at that time you could identify a bullet fired from that barrel
as having been fired from the barrel to the exclusion of all other barrels,
because there is no system whatever to the drilling of the barrel. The only
system is in the rifling or in the cutting of the grooves, and in this case of rifle
barrels, even the cutters wear down as the barrels are made, eventually of
course having to be discarded or re-sharpened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you examined consecutively manufactured barrels to
determine whether their microscopic characteristics are identical?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I have three different sets of, you might say, paired
barrels, which have been manufactured on the same machine, one after the
other, under controlled conditions to make them as nearly alike as possible,
and in each case fired bullets from those barrels could not be identified with
each other; in fact, they looked nothing at all alike as far as individual microscopic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
characteristics are concerned. Their rifling impressions of course would
be identical, but the individual marks there would be entirely different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, did you determine the weight of the exhibit&mdash;that
is, 399?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. Exhibit 399 weighs 158.6 grains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How much weight loss does that show from the original bullet
weight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. We measured several standard bullets, and their weights varied,
which is a normal situation, a portion of a grain, or two grains, from 161
grains&mdash;that is, they were all in the vicinity of 161 grains. One weighed&mdash;160.85,
161.5, 161.1 grains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In your opinion, was there any weight loss?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There did not necessarily have to be any weight loss to the
bullet. There may be a slight amount of lead missing from the base of the
bullet, since it is exposed at the base, and the bullet is slightly flattened;
there could be a slight weight loss from the end of the bullet, but it would not
amount to more than 4 grains, because 158.6 is only a grain and a half less than
the normal weight, and at least a 2 grain variation would be allowed. So it
would be approximately 3 or 4 grains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Were the markings on the bullet at all defaced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; they were, in that the bullet is distorted by having been
slightly flattened or twisted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How material would you call that defacement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is hardly visible unless you look at the base of the bullet
and notice it is not round.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How far does it affect your examination for purposes of
identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It had no effect on it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Because it did not mutilate or distort the original microscopic
marks beyond the point where you could recognize the pattern and find the
same pattern of marks on one bullet as were present on the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take a photograph of your comparison of Exhibit
399 with a test bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This photograph was prepared by you or under your
supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you tell us the magnification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 70 diameters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And this reads C-14 on the left and C-l on the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have that admitted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The one on the right is the cartridge that you <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. 399, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. 399?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. And the one on the left is the test bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The test. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be 566, Mr. Reporter.</p>

<p>(The item so described was identified as Commission Exhibit No. 566 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, could you discuss photograph 566?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This exhibit shows on the left side of a dividing vertical line
representing the top of the prism in the microscope which was used for the
comparison, a portion of the surface from the test bullet from the rifle, 139,
and on the right side of the photograph a portion of the surface of the bullet, 399.</p>

<p>The marks shown in the photograph are on an area representing approximately
one-half of one groove impression in the barrel of the weapon, which
extends from approximately 2 inches up from the bottom of the photograph, being
the edge of one land impression, and the beginning of a groove impression, up
to the top of the photograph, that area being approximately one-half or possibly
two-thirds of a groove impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
The microscopic marks which were used in the identification, after being observed
through the microscope and making the comparison and the identification,
were photographed, and this photograph shows a portion of the surface of that
bullet, showing parallel lines extending from the left side of the photograph
coming up to the hairline and continuing across on the right side of the photograph,
these microscopic marks being very fine grooves and ridges on the surface
of the bullet, very coarse ridges on the surface of the bullet, and inbetween size
scratches left on the bullet by the barrel of the weapon.</p>

<p>There will be some marks which will not show up on one bullet which show
up on the other bullet, and similarly some marks on the other bullet, in this case
Exhibit 399, will not be present on the test bullet, that stiuation being due to a
number of causes.</p>

<p>One, the bullets could have originally been slightly different in diameter, the
larger bullet, of course, picking up more marks during its passage through the
barrel.</p>

<p>Secondly, the two bullets may not have expanded exactly the same, due to the
pressure of the powder behind them as they passed through the barrel.</p>

<p>Third, with each bullet fired through the barrel, there are certain changes that
occur due to the wearing away of the surface of the metal of the barrel, so that
after a series of shots through a particular barrel, it would be expected that
the pattern of microscopic marks produced by it would change.</p>

<p>The identification is based on areas such as this on the bullet and the comparison
of the microscopic marks around the entire surface of the bullet which bears
individual characteristics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, running through the middle of the exhibit there
seem to be finer lines on the right-hand side than on the left. Could you explain
that, the reason why the lines come out with more detail or that there are more
lines on the right side than on the left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Those marks could be the result of the bullet striking some object
after it was fired, or they could be the result of changes having taken place in
the barrel.</p>

<p>For instance, even a piece of coarse cloth, leather or some other object could
have polished the surface of the metal slightly and left infinitesimal scratches
which, when enlarged sufficiently, actually look like marks on the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In making your examination of the bullet, what was the relative
attention you gave to the broader lines we see in this picture and the finer
lines such as those we have just been referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The broader lines would be more characteristic or they are
looked for most, because they change less rapidly than the fine lines. For instance,
firing two or three bullets through a barrel could completely erase
microscopic marks which would appear as fine lines in a certain area, whereas
the coarser lines and grooves on the bullet would be maintained over a series of
fired bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In evaluating these lines, do you examine the lines individually,
or are you interested in their relationship with one another in addition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is a combination. You actually examine each mark and each
line individually, but it is a mental process rather than a matter of adding one
line to another. It is a process of looking at a series of lines and you actually
notice that they are composed of round-topped ridges, <span class="sym">V</span>-topped ridges, flat-topped
ridges, and it is a mental process of looking at the whole pattern rather than
the individual marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. All these lines that we are looking at lie within a groove,
within one groove, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; except for the lower portion of the photograph, there is a
portion of a land impression showing one rather deep groove running across the
bottom of the picture, and a series of grooves shown next to the edge of the land
impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Will you identify the circular-looking mark on the right-hand
side of the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That could be either a flaw in the bullet, the metal itself, before
it was fired, or could be the result of the bullet having struck some object after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
it was fired and before it stopped, or as it stopped, or could be the result of
having been dropped or roughly handled.</p>

<p>This particular mark there would be invisible practically speaking to the
naked eye when looking at the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. The mark to which you refer is the one on the right-hand side
of the exhibit toward the top, about an inch and a half from the center line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that about 11 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have another photograph, Mr. Frazier, of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I now hand you a bullet fragment, what appears to be a bullet
fragment, in a pill box which is labeled Jacket and Lead Q-2, and it has certain
initials on it. For the record, this was found&mdash;this bullet fragment was found&mdash;in
the front portion of the car in which the President was riding. I ask you
whether you are familiar with this object.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is your mark on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you examine this? Is this a bullet fragment, Mr.
Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir. This consists of a piece of the jacket portion of a
bullet from the nose area and a piece of the lead core from under the jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How were you able to conclude it is part of the nose area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Because of the rifling marks which extend part way up the
side, and then have the characteristic leading edge impressions and no longer
continue along the bullet, and by the fact that the bullet has a rounded contour
to it which has not been mutilated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you examine this bullet to determine whether it had
been fired from Exhibit 139 to the exclusion of all other weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This bullet fragment was fired in this rifle, 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, did you weigh this fragment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I did. It weighs 44.6 grains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take a photograph of the fragment as compared
with a test bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This photograph is labeled C-14 on the left and C-2 on the
right, and it is a photograph taken by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. C-14 being the test bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The test bullet from 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what is the magnification of this photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would be 70 diameters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may that be admitted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. C-2 is the actual fragment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can we go back a second? I don't think I asked for admission
of the bullet fragment which Mr. Frazier identified. May I have that
admitted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The bullet fragment will be 567 and the photograph just
identified by Mr. Frazier will be 568.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The items described, identified as Commission Exhibits Nos. 567 and 568, were
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, could you discuss this photograph with us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. In Commission Exhibit 568 is again the vertical dividing line
through the center of the photograph, with the test bullet from the rifle 139<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
on the left, and the bullet, Exhibit 567, on the right. Am I right in that the
bullet jacket fragment is 567?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I think I put it down here. That is right, 567.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Approximately two-thirds of a groove impression from each of
the two bullets is shown, with a very small portion at the bottom of the photograph
of a land impression. The individual microscopic characteristics which
were used in the comparison, and on which the identification was made, were
photographed and are as shown in this photograph. However, this photograph
did not enter into the actual conclusion reached. The microscopic characteristics
appear as parallel horizontal lines extending from the test bullet on the left to
the bullet Exhibit 567 on the right.</p>

<p>The marks used in the identification are grooves, paired lines, a series of
ridges up and down the hairline on one bullet, and they also appear on the
opposite side of the photograph.</p>

<p>In one particular instance it will be seen that at the edge of the land impression
at the lower left portion of the photograph is a very definite paired ridge
which appears on the right side of the photograph but in a slightly different
area.</p>

<p>The reason for the difference in the location of this paired line on the exhibit,
Exhibit 567, can be explained by the fact that this is a jacket fragment, that it
was torn from the rest of the bullet, and is greatly mutilated, distorted, and bears
only a very few areas suitable for identification purposes because of that fact.</p>

<p>The distortion has foreshortened the area of the jacket fragment, 567, to the
extent that over this approximately one-tenth-of-an-inch surface represented
in this photograph, these lines do not coincide exactly on the lower part of
the photograph when they are lined up on the upper part of the photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say they don't correspond exactly, do you mean
at all, or do you mean they <span class="locked">aren't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I mean that the marks are present, but they do not line up at
the hairline.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But in your opinion the marks on the left are the same
as the marks on the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The marks on the left are the same marks as those on the
right. In the examination this is easily determined by rotating the two
bullets. As you rotate them, you can see these characteristic patterns line up.</p>

<p>Then you will notice these do not line up. But as you rotate one bullet, you
can follow the individual marks mentally and see that the same pattern is present
and you can line them up in your mind, even though they are not actually
physically lined up in the microscope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They are not lined up in the microscope because there is mutilation
on the fragment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And there is no mutilation on the test cartridge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, in the lower portion of each side of that photograph,
which I take it is the groove of the bullet, or the land impression of the
rifle&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The land on the rifle leaves this groove on the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes; the right-hand side seems to be slightly striated while the
left-hand side does not seem to be striated. Can you explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, the striae in this side are not apparent in this photograph.
I don't know whether they actually exist on the bullet or not. You can't tell from
the photograph, because they are so fine as to possibly not show at all.</p>

<p>A close examination right at the hairline shows a whole series of very fine
scratches which do not appear further away from the hairline, and that could be
very easily due to differences in the metal, as the bullet passed down the barrel,
being pressed less forcibly against the barrel, or could also be due to the fact that
at the edges of the lands it is very often evident that hot gases from the burning
powder had passed the bullet through these cracks and actually will melt or
erode away the surface of the bullet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
As to why they may or may not be present is difficult to say from an examination
of the photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What portion of the bullet fragment provided enough markings
for purposes of identification, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would say that one-fourth, in this instance, one-fourth of 567's
surface was available. One-fifth to one-sixth would have been sufficient for
identification, based on the character of the marks present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now this portion of the fragment was an even smaller portion
of the bullet, the entire bullet, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So when you say one-fifth and one-sixth, are you referring now
to the proportion of marks on the fragment, as opposed to the proportion of marks
you would want from an entire bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; I am referring to the proportion of marks on the fragment
which were used in the examination as compared to the total bullet circumference
which would have existed on an unmutilated bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, do you feel that the amount of markings here
were sufficient to make positive identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you made identifications in the past with as few or less
markings as are present on this bullet fragment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes; and on less, much less of an area. The character of the
marks is more important than the number of the marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, here you were of course unable to see all of the
lines which were present on the bullet before mutilation. Have you ever had an
occasion where you examined a bullet and saw one portion of it which was an
apparent match and then found out that the balance of the bullet was not an
apparent match?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; and if I understand your words "apparent match," there
is no such thing as an apparent match. It either is an identification or it isn't,
and until you have made up your mind, you don't have an apparent match. We
don't actually use that term in the FBI. Unless you have sufficient marks for an
identification, you cannot say one way or the other as to whether or not two
bullets were fired from a particular barrel.</p>

<p>In other words, you cannot nonidentify on the absence of similarities any more
than you can identify when you have no similarities present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In other words, you won't make an identification unless you
feel enough marks are present to constitute a basis for a positive identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is right, and I would not report any type of similarities
unless they were sufficient for an identification, because unless you can say one
bullet was fired from the same barrel as a second bullet, then there is room for
error, and in this field of firearms identification, we try to avoid any possible
chance of error creeping in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you avoid the category of "probable" identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes; we never use it, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And why is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There is no such thing as a probable identification. It either is
or isn't as far as we are concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And in this case it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Any further questions on this bullet fragment, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Do we have any proof in the record thus far as to where the
fragment referred to a moment ago came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Honestly, I am not sure. I know it will be in the record
eventually, but I have not taken that up as part of this testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That will be subject to further proof.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. If it is not in the record. As a result of all these comparisons,
you would say that the evidence is indisputable that the three shells that were
identified by you were fired from that rifle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And you would say the same thing of Commission Exhibit 399,
the bullet 399 was fired from that rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And the fragment <span class="locked">567&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 567, the one we have just finished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Was likewise a portion of a bullet fired from that rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You have no doubt about any of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now finally in the category of bullets and bullet fragments,
I hand you what is apparently a bullet fragment, which is in a pill box marked
Q-3, and which, I state for the record, was also found in the front portion of
the President's car, and I ask you whether you are familiar with this item,
marked Q-3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; this was submitted to me as having been found beside
the front seat of the automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Your mark is on that fragment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When did you receive that fragment, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. At 11:50 p.m., November 22, 1963, from Special Agent Orrin
Bartlett, our liaison agent with the Secret Service, in the FBI laboratory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the last bullet fragment you examined, Exhibit 567, when
did you receive that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was received at the same time from Special Agent Bartlett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you examine both at that time, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; beginning the following morning, November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this bullet fragment marked Q-3
admitted as Commission 569?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The item, identified as Commission Exhibit No. 569, was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, did you examine this bullet fragment with a
view to determining whether it had been fired from the rifle, Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. This bullet fragment, Exhibit 569, was fired from this particular
rifle, 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again to the exclusion of all other rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you weigh this fragment, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I did. It weighs 21.0 grains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe the fragment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. It consists of the base or most rearward portion of the
jacket of a metal-jacketed bullet, from which the lead core is missing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How can you tell that it is the most rearward portion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It has the shape which bases of bullets have. It has the cannelure
which is located at the rear, on the portion of bullets of this type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you determine whether this bullet fragment, 567, and 569
are portions of the originally same bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You cannot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. There is not enough of the two fragments in unmutilated condition
to determine whether or not the fragments actually fit together.</p>

<p>However, it was determined that there is no area on one fragment, such as
567, which would overlap a corresponding area on the base section of 569, so
that they could be parts of one bullet, and then, of course, they could be parts of
separate bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now 569 is without the core; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you estimate how much weight you would add if you
had the core?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, I cannot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Not at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No. I do not have the figure on the core weight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In your opinion, is it possible that if you did make such an
estimate, the weight, the projected weight of 569 plus the actual weight of 567
would exceed the bullet weight of the 6.5 mm. bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, no; it would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. It would not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would not come even close to it, because the amount of core
is only&mdash;one-quarter inch of the bullet is all that remains at the base, and that
much core would not weigh more than 40 grains at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. No cannelure shows on 567, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, did you make a comparison photograph of 569
with a test bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This photograph is marked C-14 on the left and C-3 on the
right; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. C-14 being the test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, from the rifle 139, and C-3 is Exhibit 569.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the magnification on this photograph is what, Mr.
Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 70 diameters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And this was taken by you or under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this admitted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. 570.</p>

<p>(The item was identified as Commission Exhibit No. 570 and was received in
evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you discuss this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Commission Exhibit 570 shows a portion of the test bullet from
Exhibit 139 on the left side of the photograph, and a portion of the bullet 569
on the right side, divided by a hairline.</p>

<p>The photograph was taken of the microscopic marks, examined through the
comparison microscope, consisting of very fine and very coarse grooves, or
scratches, or ridges, on the surface of each of the bullets as compared with those
on the other bullet.</p>

<p>The photograph did not, of course, enter into the conclusion reached in the
examination, but was merely taken to demonstrate, to illustrate the types of
marks present insofar as a photograph can show them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, what portion of the Exhibit 569 was unmutilated
enough to allow you to make a comparison of its markings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Approximately one-third. Actually, the entire base section of
the bullet was present, but approximately one-half of that base was mutilated.
On the mutilated area, either marks were destroyed completely by striking some
object, or being compressed or stretched, or they were thrown out of relationship
with each other by stretching or compressing to the extent that they were of
no value.</p>

<p>So I would estimate approximately one-third of the area was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, when you say one-third, is this total area or circumference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Circumference&mdash;one-third of the circumference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have any further pictures of any of the bullets, Mr.
Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, I hand you two bullets and ask whether you are
familiar with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I am. These are the two test bullets which I fired from
this rifle, Exhibit 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do they have your mark on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, they do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have these admitted as Exhibit 572?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 572, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Getting back to the two bullet fragments mentioned, Mr.
Frazier, did you alter them in any way after they had been received in the
laboratory, by way of cleaning or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; there was a very slight residue of blood or some other
material adhering, but it did not interfere with the examination. It was
wiped off to clean up the bullet for examination, but it actually would not have
been necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that true on both fragments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You also mentioned there was blood or some other substance
on the bullet marked 399. Is this an off-hand determination, or was there a test
to determine what the substance was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, there was no test made of the materials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. As you examined the bullet and the two bullet fragments,
are they in the same condition now as they were when they entered your hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. One other question on the cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Did you examine the cartridge cases for chambering marks, extraction marks,
or ejection marks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I did, but I did not make any comparisons of either extractor
or ejector marks or chambering marks, since the purpose of my examination
was primarily to determine whether they were fired in this rifle, and such
marks would not have assisted in that determination. They were not necessary
because they would have indicated only that it may have been loaded into
and extracted from the weapon, whereas the marks which I found served to
identify it as having been fired in the weapon, actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, unless you have further questions on the
cartridge cases or bullets, I would like to move on to another subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. From your examination of the actual bullets that you have
been told were fired on the day of the assassination from this rifle, and from
your&mdash;how many separate bullets do you identify?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Two, at the maximum&mdash;possibly three, if these two jacket fragments
came from different bullets. If they came from one bullet, then there
would be a maximum of the whole bullet 399 and this bullet in two parts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And you cannot tell whether these two particles came from one
bullet or two separate ones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say "two at the maximum," do you mean two at the
minimum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I meant at least two bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. There were at least two different bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. At least two, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, can you give an estimate of the total number
of bullets fired in the various tests made with this rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Approximately 60 rounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And were all of these rounds 6.5 mm. Western Mannlicher-Carcano
ammunition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you have any misfires?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you find the ammunition dependable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Very dependable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you think of any reason why someone might think this
is an undependable type of ammunition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; The Western Cartridge Co. has always manufactured,
in my experience, very dependable ammunition. There is other ammunition
on the market available for this particular rifle in this caliber, which in my
opinion is undependable or would be a very poor quality of ammunition. It
may have been a confusion between that other ammunition of the same caliber
and this Western ammunition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you elaborate as to what that other ammunition consists
of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Certain companies have imported into the United States cartridges
of foreign manufacture. Those I have seen for this rifle were of Italian
manufacture. They have pulled the military bullets from those cartridges and
reloading hunting type or soft-point bullets into the cartridges. In doing that,
they did not, apparently, take any great pains in loading them. Occasionally,
the mouth of the case would be bent over and the bullet driven in right on top
of the bent case.</p>

<p>I have seen split cartridge cases, even before they were fired, badly corroded
cartridge cases. All in all, the ammunition is of generally poor overall
appearance, and it has been reported to me that it was of poor firing quality.</p>

<p>I have not fired any of it, personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you heard anything about the dependability of the
Italian-made ammunition, unreloaded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; not as such.</p>

<p>However, I have experienced the examination of Italian ammunition of
various years of manufacture and, of course, various makes. And I think it
is rather poor quality in this particular caliber, primarily due to the very short
seating depth to which bullets of this type are seated in the cartridge, which
causes the bullets to loosen very readily in the cartridge case even before they
are loaded into a clip or fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you notice, Mr. Frazier, in your examination of targets
and so forth, whether there was any marked degree of yaw or tumbling by
the bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No evidence at all of tumbling or yaw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In your opinion, would the firing of 60 shots materially
affect the microscopic characteristics of Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It would change them, if not completely, practically completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, some witnesses to the assassination have stated
that they heard more than three shots. Can you think of any reason why they
might have come to that conclusion&mdash;in terms of acoustical properties of high-velocity
bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. They could very readily have heard other sounds which could
be confused with shots. It is apparent&mdash;it is obvious with any weapon in
which the bullet travels faster than the speed of sound, which is 1,127, approximately,
feet per second, the bullet itself will cause a shock wave or a sound
wave, and a person standing in front of that weapon will hear the report of
the bullet passing and then subsequently the sound will reach them of the
cartridge explosion, which could very easily be confused with two shots. There
will be the crack of the bullet going by, overhead or in the vicinity, and then
the sound of the shot.</p>

<p>So that you would hear for three shots actually six reports, which could
have caused some confusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, I now hand you a bullet in a pill box which is
marked Q-188. I ask you whether you are familiar with this bullet.</p>

<p>I would like to state for the record that this bullet was found in the Walker
residence after the attempted assassination of General Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. As far as you know, we have no proof of that yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I am familiar with it. I have made an examination of
that bullet.</p>

<p>With reference to this bullet, I could furnish everything except the weight
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. All right. Just taking one thing at a time. You are familiar
with it. Does it have your marking on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this admitted as 573?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 573, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When did you receive this bullet, do you recall, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I would need to refer to my notes for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you supply that for us at a subsequent time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the weight.</p>

<p>Is this bullet in the same condition as it was when you received it in the
laboratory, Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you clean it up or in any way alter it when you received
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, did you examine this bullet to determine whether
it was or might have been fired in Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I was unable to reach a conclusion as to whether or not it had
been fired from this rifle. The conclusion went slightly further than that, in
that we determined that the general rifling characteristics of the rifle 139 are
of the same type as those found on the bullet, Exhibit 573, and, further, on this
basis, that the bullet could have been fired from the rifle on the basis of its land
and groove impressions. And, second, that all of the remaining physical characteristics
of this bullet, 573, are the same as Western 6.5mm. Mannlicher-Carcano
bullets of the type normally loaded in ammunition made for this rifle,
139. However, the mutilation of the nose of the bullet has eliminated the length
characteristics, and it cannot be definitely stated that Exhibit 573 is in fact
a Western Cartridge Co. product, but all of the remaining characteristics
of base shape, distance from the base to the cannelure, the width of the
cannelure, and the overall appearance, coloration, and so forth, are similar to
Western ammunition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is this a jacketed bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it is a copper-alloy jacketed bullet having a lead core.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you think of any reason why someone might have called
this a steel-jacketed bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; except that some individuals commonly refer to rifle
bullets as steel-jacketed bullets, when they actually in fact just have a copper-alloy
jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe the general rifling characteristics which
you referred to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. They consist of impressions from four lands and grooves.
The bullet is mutilated on a portion of its surface. However, it can be determined
that there were four land impressions and four groove impressions
originally on this bullet.</p>

<p>The width of the land impression is 7/100ths of an inch, that is 0.07 inch&mdash;whereas
the width of the groove impression is 0.13 inch, or 13/100ths of an
inch.</p>

<p>The bullet is flattened so that it was not possible to measure its diameter.
However, by adding the land width to the groove width, and multiplying by the
number of lands and grooves, you can determine the circumference of the
bullet and mathematically determine its diameter, which in this case corresponds
to 6.5 mm. ammunition, or approximately .267 inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was the direction of the twist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. To the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you estimate how many types of rifle would produce, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
a 6.5 mm. bullet, four lands and four grooves, right twist, with the width of
lands and grooves which you established as being those on this bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Only from experience, I could say that it would be relatively
few which would agree with all of those characteristics. I have, of course, not
seen or measured all of the foreign rifles, and therefore I could not estimate
the number that there might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you find any miscroscopic characteristics or other evidence
which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Were you able to determine the depth of the grooves of
the bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The bullet, 573, had what appeared to be normal-depth grooves.</p>

<p>However, this bullet is completely flattened due to hitting a plaster or cement
or other hard material on one side, and the opposite side, as a result of the
flattening&mdash;has assumed a concave appearance, which has stretched the surface
in various places and changes its overall appearance&mdash;that is the basis for
actually having to state that there were not enough unmutilated marks for identification
purposes on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But you do conclude that this was fired from a Mannlicher-Carcano
91/38, or a rifle with similar barrel characteristics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, do you have any further questions on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. When you say you were able to determine it was fired from
this type of rifle or one similar to it, that would include a number of different
kinds of rifles besides the Mannlicher-Carcano?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it could include a variety of weapons with which I
am not familiar in the foreign field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But it is definitely, according to your best judgment, a 6.5 mm.
bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. And the bullet, such as we find it, has now characteristics similar
to the type of bullet which was our Exhibit No. 399?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it does. Placing them side by side, the cannelure, which
is really the only physical characteristic apparent, comes to exactly the same
place on both 399 and 573, indicating that this bullet was loaded to exactly the
same depth in the cartridge&mdash;the two bullets, both 399 and 573.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I think I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Frazier, did any other firearms experts in the FBI
laboratory examine the three cartridge cases, the bullet, and the two bullet
fragments which you have testified as to today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, all of the actual firearms comparisons were also made by
Charles Killion and Cortlandt Cunningham. These examinations were made
separately, that is, they made their examination individually and separately from
mine, and there was no association between their examination and mine until
both were finished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did the three of you come to the conclusions which you have
given us today as your own conclusions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did anyone in the FBI laboratory who examined the evidence
come to a different conclusion as to any of the evidence you have discussed
today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there anything you would like to add to your testimony,
Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Not with reference to this material, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are you thinking <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I am thinking of other examinations which I made, but which
probably will come up at another time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You are referring to examinations such as the clothing, holes
in the clothing, and the fracture in the automobile windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes. There will be testimony elicited at another time on those
examinations, Mr. Frazier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Mr. Frazier will be a witness in those, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Specter will probably elicit that testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, or gentlemen, are there any other questions?</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Frazier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Excuse me. I have one photograph here that might be useful
in this regard, and that is of a clip showing the six cartridges loaded into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I think that might be a good idea. You might identify that,
to show what we mean by clips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You have shown us photographs of a clip&mdash;the clip from the
Exhibit 139 rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. One photograph loaded, and one unloaded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes. In one instance I put six cartridges in the clip and photographed
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take those photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Mr. Frazier, you testified that if you didn't use the clip you
would only be able to shoot one shell at a time, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; this weapon does not have the box magazine commonly
found in most military weapons which holds the cartridges and can be reloaded
one at a time, but they must remain in the clip, or they will malfunction.
The follower in the weapon will throw the cartridges right back out of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That explains it to my mind, because I know I have fired rifles
with clips and fired them without clips. But they were much more convenient
in loading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; this one is <span class="locked">designed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. For example, the Springfield you could load with clip or load
without a clip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But this one has to have a clip in order not to malfunction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Those will be 574 and 575.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photographs referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 574 and
575, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Frazier. You have been very helpful.</p>

<h2 id="rs">TESTIMONY OF RONALD SIMMONS</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Our next witness will be Mr. Simmons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Would you hold up your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this hearing will
be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Please be seated.</p>

<p>This, as you know&mdash;the constitution of the Commission and its purpose&mdash;we
want to ask you something about the firearm aspect of our hearings, and certain
characteristics of this rifle that we would like to hear from you about, and if
there is anything else you have that can throw light on our problems.</p>

<p>If you can state for the record, first, your name, and where you live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. My name is Ronald Simmons. I live near Havre de Grace, Md.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Mr. Eisenberg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give us your position, Mr. Simmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I am the Chief of the Infantry Weapons Evaluation Branch
of the Ballistics Research Laboratory of the Department of the Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And how long have you held this position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. This position, about four years, and previous employment has
been in these laboratories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How long have you been working, Mr. Simmons, in the area
of evaluation of weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Since 1951, in various classes of weapons.</p>

<p>Since 1957, however, I have had the responsibility for the laboratories on
small arms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Has part of it&mdash;of these&mdash;have part of these evaluations been
conducted with military rifles, Mr. Simmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Most of our evaluations have been associated with military
rifles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How long altogether have you spent in this area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. In the area of rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Some experience beginning from about 1953. I have been
continuously concerned with this since 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give a rough estimate of how many weapons you
have evaluated as to accuracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. No. We have been concerned with almost all of the weapons
which the Army has tested, either in preliminary stages or as developmental
weapons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But your specialty is the evaluation of weapons systems, including
military rifles, and you have been engaged in this for 13 years, as to
all weapons systems, and since 1953 as <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. In the course of that you have examined hundreds of rifles,
though, have you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Well, our examination of rifles is not the detailed engineering,
design experiment which a gunsmith or a rifle expert as such would concern
himself with. We are more concerned with establishing a framework by which
we can put numbers to the performance of military rifles in tactical employment.
And this means that for a specific&mdash;specific classes of weapons, we have
had to establish, for example, round-to-round dispersion, the accuracy with
which they can be employed, and the wounding power of the projectiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. In the course of this you have fired a great many rifles yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. No, sir; I don't fire them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Somebody else fires them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. But you make the studies in relation to the accuracy of the
weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes, that is correct. The firing is accomplished by employees
of the development and proof services, which is the weapons testing facility at
the Aberdeen Proving Ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Your task is primarily <span class="locked">evaluation&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Of the characteristics of the rifle, particularly in terms of its
accuracy and its wounding power, killing power?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may this witness be admitted as an expert to
testify in this area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, did you conduct a test from a machine rest, a
test of round-to-round dispersion of this weapon, or have such tests conducted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. May I check the serial number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I should ask first if you are familiar with this weapon.</p>

<p>I have handed the witness Commission Exhibit 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes. We fired this weapon from a machine rest for round-to-round
dispersion. We fired exactly 20 rounds in this test, and the dispersion
which we measured is of conventional magnitude, about the same that we get
with our present military rifles, and the standard deviation of dispersion is
.29 mil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is a fraction of a degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. A mil is an angular measurement. There are 17.7 mils to
a degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do I understand your testimony to be that this rifle is as accurate
as the current American military rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes. As far as we can determine from bench-rest firing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you consider that to be a high degree of accuracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes, the weapon is quite accurate. For most small arms, we
discover that the round-to-round dispersion is of the order of three-tenths of
a mil. We have run into some unusual ones, however, which give us higher
values, but very few which give us smaller values, except in selected lots of
ammunition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You are talking about the present military rifle&mdash;will you
designate it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. The M-14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Is it as accurate as the Springfield 1906 ammunition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I am not familiar with the difference between the M-14 in
its accuracy and the 1906 Springfield. These are very similar in their
dispersion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. At a hundred yards, what does that amount to? What is the
dispersion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Well, at a hundred yards, one mil is 3.6 inches, and 0.3 of that
is a little more than an inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You tested this with what type of ammunition, Mr. Simmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. The ammunition was labeled Type Ball, and it was made by
the Western Cartridge Co., Division of Olin Industries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was that a 6.5 mm.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. 6.5-mm. Mannlicher-Carcano.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In the course of this test from a machine rest, Mr. Simmons,
did you also attempt to determine the muzzle velocity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes; we also measured muzzle velocities for approximately
10 rounds of the ammunition. We gather from these measurements that the
nominal velocity, the nominal muzzle velocity is of the order of 2,200 feet per
second, and the velocity at about 200 feet from the muzzle is approximately
2,000 feet per second. And there is some variation in velocity from round
to round as there is with all small-arms ammunition. But the variation is
relatively small, and within the same order of magnitude as for conventional
ammunition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you test the bullets for yaw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes; we measured yaw also, and all measurements of yaw
were also small. We had no values in excess of 2 degrees, and many values
were less than 1 degree in yaw, indicating that the round is quite stable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How did you test for yaw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. We took spark shadowgraph pictures at various stations down
range from the muzzle, so that we actually have pictures of the position of the
bullet relative to the top and bottom of our range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you bring those pictures with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. No; I do not have them with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you furnish those to the Commission at a later date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. They could be made available later. I would like to point out
these are not pictures, however. They are on large pieces of glass, and they are
not photos.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can they be read by a layman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. That I do not know. I do not read them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, I wonder whether you can send them up, and we could
take a look at them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes; we can have them forwarded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was it reported to you by the persons who ran the machine-rest
tests whether they had any difficulties with sighting the weapon in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Well, they could not sight the weapon in using the telescope,
and no attempt was made to sight it in using the iron sight. We did adjust the
telescopic sight by the addition of two shims, one which tended to adjust the
azimuth, and one which adjusted an elevation. The azimuth correction could
have been made without the addition of the shim, but it would have meant that
we would have used all of the adjustment possible, and the shim was a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
convenient means&mdash;not more convenient, but a more permanent means of correction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. By azimuth, do you refer to the crosshair which is sometimes
referred to as the windage crosshair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you recognize these shims that I display to you, Mr.
Simmons, as being the shims that were placed in the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I saw the shims only when they were in the weapon, but those
look very much like what was evident from the external view, after they were
in place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, Mr. Chairman, these shims were given to
me by the FBI who told me that they had removed them from the weapon after
they had been placed there by Mr. Simmons' laboratory.</p>

<p>May I have these introduced as evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, I find there are three shims here. You mentioned
two. Would three be consistent with what you were told?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I was told two. These were put in by a gunsmith in one of
our machine shops&mdash;rather a machinist in one of our machine shops.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, I wonder whether you could take these shims
back after I have marked them to find out whether the three had been placed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I am marking these 576, 577, and 578. They consist of three
shims in three small envelopes.</p>

<p>(The items referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 576, 577, and
578, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, did you have a test run to determine the
possibility of scoring hits with this weapon, Exhibit 139, on a given target at
a given distance under rapid-fire conditions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes; we did. We placed three targets, which were head
and shoulder silhouettes, at distances of 175 feet, 240 feet, and 265 feet, and
these distances are slant ranges from the window ledge of a tower which is
about 30 feet high. We used three firers in an attempt to obtain hits on all
three targets within as short a time interval as possible.</p>

<p>I should make one comment here relative to the angular displacement of
the targets. We did not reproduce these angles exactly from the map which
we had been given because the conditions in the field were a little awkward
for this. But the distance&mdash;the angular distance from the first target to the
second was greater than from the second to the third, which would tend to
correspond to a longer interval of time between the first and second impact
than between the second and the third. The movement of the rifle was
greater from the first to the second target than from the second to the third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, were your marksmen instructed to aim at
the three targets in consecutive order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. The marksmen were instructed to take as much time as they
desired at the first target, and then to fire&mdash;at the first target, being at 175
feet&mdash;to then fire at the target emplaced at 240 feet, and then at the one at
265 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you state where you derived these distances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. These distances were the values given on the survey map
which were given to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are you sure they were not the values I gave to you myself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I stand corrected. These are values&mdash;we were informed that
the numbers on the survey map were possibly in error. The distances are
very close, however.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, the figures which I gave Mr. Simmons are
approximations and are not to be taken as the Commission's conclusive determination
of what those distances are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. For our experiment, I do not see how a difference of a few
feet would make any difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Simmons, did you take pictures or have pictures
taken showing what that range looked like?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes; I have copies of these pictures here. I show you three
pictures&mdash;the first showing the window from which the weapon was fired in
our experiments; the second showing the view of the three targets from the
window; and the third showing a rifleman in position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, did you take these pictures yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. No; these pictures were taken by one of the cameramen
from the development and proof services.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you see the scenes represented in these pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are these pictures accurate reproductions of these scenes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like to have the first, second, and
third pictures described by Mr. Simmons admitted as exhibits. That will be
579 for the first, 580 for the second, and 581 for the third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photographs referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 579,
580, and 581 and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, the targets were&mdash;well, can you describe the
targets for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. The targets are standard head-and-shoulders silhouettes, and
they consist of approximately 2 square feet in area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How many marksmen were involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. We used three riflemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And can you tell us what their background was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes. All three riflemen are rated as Master by the National
Rifle Association. Two of them are civilian gunners in the Small Arms Division
of our Development and Proof Services, and the third is presently in the Army,
and he has considerable background as a rifleman, and also has a Master
rating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Each fired one or more series of three rounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Each fired two series of three rounds, using the telescopic
sight. Then one of the firers repeated the exercise using the iron sight&mdash;because
we had no indication whether the telescope had been used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So the total number of rounds fired was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. 21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you bring with you targets or copies of the targets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I brought photos of the targets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take these photographs, Mr. Simmons, or have them
taken under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. These photographs were taken by the photographic laboratory
in our Ballistic Measurements Laboratory, which is one of the complex of
laboratories within the Ballistic Research Laboratory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you verify these photographs as being accurate reproductions
of the targets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have these admitted as 582, 583 and 584?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photographs referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 582,
583, and 584 for identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, could you discuss the results of the tests you
ran, by using these photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Exhibit 582 is the target which was emplaced at 175 feet. All
firers hit the first target, and this was to be expected, because they had as much
time as they desired to aim at the first target.</p>

<p>As you can see from the picture, the accuracy of the weapon is quite good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. That first target is what distance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. 175 feet. And we had to make an assumption here about the
point of aim. It is quite likely that in fact each man was aiming at a different
portion of the target&mdash;there were no markings on the target visible to the firer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did I understand you just told the firers to aim at the target
without referring <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. There is an apparent crossline running darkly through that
photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. These lines were drawn in afterwards, in order for us to make
some measurements from the actual impact point.</p>

<p>The target which was emplaced at 240 feet, as shown in Exhibit 583&mdash;we had
rather an unusual coincidence with respect to this target. This involved the
displacement of the weapon to a sufficient angle that the basic firing position
of the man had to be changed. And because they knew time was very important,
they made the movement very quickly. And for the first four attempts,
the firers missed the second target. Of course, we made a rather, I guess, disadvantageous
error in the test by pointing out that they had missed on the
second target, and there was a conscious effort made on the additional rounds
to hit the second target.</p>

<p>On the third target, the angle through which the weapon had to be moved to
get to the third target from the second was relatively small, and there were
only two rounds which did not hit the target at 270 feet. One of these rounds,
by the way, was used in the sequence where the iron sight was employed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, when you said that the firers had to make a
large shift relatively in their firing position, and were in a hurry, is this your
interpretation or is this based on discussions with them subsequently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. This is based on discussions with the firers after the experiment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. After these tests were finished, did you make a determination
of the amount of error&mdash;average amount of error in the aim of these riflemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes. By assuming that all riflemen had aimed at the intersection
of the lines that we have drawn on these pictures, we calculated the
total aiming&mdash;the aiming error associated with the three riflemen&mdash;this is one
number to describe the accuracy of all three riflemen. And against the first
target the accuracy observed was about .7 mils, in standard deviation. Against
the second target, the accuracy was 1.4 mils. And against the third target, it
was 1.2 mils.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again, could you convert those at a hundred yards to inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. 0.7 of a mil at 100 yards is approximately 2 inches. 1.4 mils is
approximately 4 inches. And 1.2 mils is approximately 3½ inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In arriving at these figures, had you discounted the round-to-round
dispersion as determined in the bench rest test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes. We have subtracted out the round-to-round dispersion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But the actual accuracy of the riflemen would have to include
the round-to-round dispersion, would it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes; it would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why did you then subtract the round-to-round dispersion
figure, or discount it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. We wanted to determine what the aiming error itself was associated
with the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give us the times in which the various riflemen used
to fire the three shots in each sequence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes. And the numbers which I will give you will be the average
of two readings on stop watches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For each rifleman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. For each exercise.</p>

<p>Mr. Hendrix fired twice. The time for the first exercise was 8.25 seconds;
the time for the second exercise was 7.0 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. Staley, on the first exercise, fired in 6¾ seconds; the second attempt he
used 6.45 seconds.</p>

<p>Specialist Miller used 4.6 seconds on his first attempt, 5.15 seconds in his
second attempt, and 4.45 seconds in his exercise using the iron sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was the accuracy of Specialist Miller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I do not have his accuracy separated from the group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is it possible to separate the accuracy out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes; it is, by an additional calculation.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller succeeded in hitting the third target on both attempts with the
telescope. He missed the second target on both attempts with the telescope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
but he hit the second target with the iron sight. And he emplaced all three
rounds on the target, the first target.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How did he do with the iron sight on the third target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. On the third target he missed the boards completely. And
we have not checked this out. It appears that for the firing posture which
Mr. Miller&mdash;Specialist Miller uses, the iron sight is not zeroed for him, since
his impacts on the first and second targets were quite high, and against the
third target we would assume that the projectile went over the top of the target,
which extended only a few inches over the top of the silhouette.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What position did the rifleman fire from, Mr. Simmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. The firers braced an elbow on the window sill and used pretty
much a standard sitting position, using a stool.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How much practice had they had with the weapon, Exhibit
139, before they began firing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. They had each attempted the exercise without the use of
ammunition, and had worked the bolt as they tried the exercise. They had not
pulled the trigger during the exercise, however, because we were a little concerned
about breaking the firing pin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you give us an estimate of how much time they used
in this dry-run practice, each?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. They used no more than 2 or 3 minutes each.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did they make any comments concerning the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes; there were several comments made&mdash;particularly with
respect to the amount of effort required to open the bolt. As a matter of fact,
Mr. Staley had difficulty in opening the bolt in his first firing exercise. He
thought it was completely up and it was not, and he had to retrace his steps as
he attempted to open the bolt after the first round.</p>

<p>There was also comment made about the trigger pull, which is different as far
as these firers are concerned. It is in effect a two-stage operation where the
first&mdash;in the first stage the trigger is relatively free, and it suddenly required a
greater pull to actually fire the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, did you prepare a table showing the probability
of hit at a given target at given ranges by riflemen with given degrees of
accuracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Well, we prepared a table which showed what the probability
of a hit would be on specific sizes of target as a function of aiming error, and
using the appropriate round-to-round dispersion also in these calculations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What were the targets that you used in your calculations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. We used two circular targets, one of 4 inches in radius and one
of 9 inches in radius, to approximate the area of the head and the area of the
shoulders, or the thorax, actually. And a significant point to these calculations
to us is that against the larger target, if you fire with the 0.7 mil aiming error
which was observed against the first target, the probability of hitting that
target is 1, and it is 1 at all three ranges, out to 270 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain the meaning of the probability being 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Well, the probability is effectively one. Actually the number
is 0.99 and several more digits afterwards. It is rounded off to 1. Simply
implying that the probability of a hit is very high with the small aiming errors
and short range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now of course this aiming error is derived from the three
riflemen who you employed in the tests, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you proceed to the other two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Using the 1.2 mil aiming error, again at the larger targets, the
probability of hitting the target at 175 feet is 1; at 240 feet it is 0.96; and at
270 feet it is 0.92.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How would you characterize the second two figures in terms of
probability?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. These also are very high values.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The mil figure was 1.2, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does that include, did you say, both aiming error and round-to-round
dispersion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. The 1.2 is the aiming error. When we include the round-to-round
dispersion, it becomes only 1.24 mils.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does the probability reflect the 1.2 or the 1.24 figure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. It reflects the total error, which is 1.24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the same on the first series of calculations you gave us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you go on to the third?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Using the 1.4 mil aiming error, and the round-to-round dispersion,
giving a total error of 1.43 mils, the probability of hit at the 175 foot
target is 0.99; at 240 feet it is 0.91; at 270 feet it is 0.85.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you give us the figures for the smaller target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Using the 0.7 mil aiming error, the probability of a hit at 175
feet is 0.96; at 240 feet, 0.81; at 270 feet, 0.73.</p>

<p>For the 1.2 mil aiming error, the probability is 0.69 at 175 feet; 0.74 at 240
feet; 0.39 at 270 feet.</p>

<p>Using <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you characterize those, or explain them in lay terms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Well, against a shorter target, the probability is still almost
0.7, which is a relatively high value. The effective-range increase is beginning
to show, however, because at 270 feet the value of 0.4 tends to be small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does 0.4 mean you have 4 chances in 10 of hitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Now, our assumption throughout all of this is that the actual target was
probably not either a small&mdash;the small area, but tending to be a larger area, as
indicated by the crosshairs in these targets which we placed at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you have given us probabilities of hit with three variations
of aiming error. You have selected these three variations in what manner,
Mr. Simmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. These were actually the three values which were demonstrated
in the experiment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But each of those values is associated with one target?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. However, you have applied them to all three targets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you have a special reason for doing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. No. We are victims of habit, and we tend to provide such
information in parametric form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Simmons, of course the assassin's aiming error must
be unknown. But do you have any opinion concerning the probable aiming
error of an assassin using this weapon against the aiming error displayed by
the three riflemen you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Well, it looks like to achieve hits as indicated, the accuracy,
overall accuracy of the three rounds would have to be of the order of 1.2 mils.
And this is really not a small number as far as marksmanship goes. There
have been many exercises in which we have been involved where the aiming
error turns out to be much smaller, smaller than this. And in match competition,
of course, the numbers actually turn out to be&mdash;the total aiming error
turns out to be about equal to the round-to-round dispersion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you make the reference to many exercises, are you
referring to exercises solely with skilled riflemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. If we have skilled riflemen, the values for aiming error tend to
be of the order of 1 mil. As a matter of fact, to qualify as expert on Army
rifle courses, about a 1 mil aiming error is required&mdash;a standard deviation
of 1 mil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that with a rest or without a rest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. This would be without a rest. This would be the actual aiming
error from the fixed position, firing range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And is this with open or telescopic sights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. This would be with the peepsight on the conventional rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you exercises which you feel would be applicable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
assassination&mdash;that is, exercises conducted with&mdash;under noncombat conditions,
with a telescopic sight and a rest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. The only experience that we have with the telescopic sight
with which I am familiar is the exercise using this weapon. There have been
experiments made using telescopic sights, but these are of limited interest
militarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In your opinion, what effect does the introduction of a rest
and telescopic sight have on probable aiming error?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. From a position where the movement of the weapon is not great,
and where the target is slowly moving, the fixed position on the telescope should
enhance the probability of a hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you think a marksman who is less than a highly skilled
marksman under those conditions would be able to shoot in the range of 1.2-mil
aiming error?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Obviously considerable experience would have to be in one's
background to do so. And with this weapon, I think also considerable experience
with this weapon, because of the amount of effort required to work the bolt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would do what? You mean would improve the accuracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes. In our experiments, the pressure to open the bolt was
so great that we tended to move the rifle off the target, whereas with greater
proficiency this might not have occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could this experience in operating the bolt be achieved in dry
practice, Mr. Simmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes; it could be, if sufficient practice were used. There is
some indication of the magnitude of change with one of our shooters who in his
second attempt fired three-tenths of a second less time than he did in the first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Simmons, has data been compiled showing the effect of
the time taken between shots on the accuracy of the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. There have been experiments run where aiming error has been
measured as a function of the time one has to aim.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do those experiments show that aiming error is directly proportionate
to the length of time one has to aim?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Not directly proportionate, but aiming error decreases as time
increases. But once you get to the area of about 4 seconds in time, then there
is very small decrease in aiming error for increase in time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Translating that to this weapon, does that mean that taking
more than 8 seconds between three shots should not appreciably affect the degree
of accuracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. The 8 seconds I was referring to is between shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You said 4 seconds, I thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I beg your pardon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And I was saying, if you took 4 seconds between the first
and second, and 4 seconds between the second and third, for a total of 8
seconds, on the basis of this data would that mean after 8 seconds you would
not be substantially increasing your accuracy by taking more time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Approximately how many bullets did you fire in the course
of your tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. We fired 47 bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you have any misfires?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Were you aware when you performed your tests of the
conclusions of any other body concerning the accuracy of this weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. No; we were not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are you aware of such conclusions at this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. No; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. You said that these riflemen, or one or two of them at least,
had the rank of master. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I again fall back on my comment earlier that I am not a
shooter myself. A master is one of the ratings given to highly qualified riflemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
by the National Rifle Association. These men have all participated in
national match competitions in the National Rifle Association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Is that a higher grade than sharpshooter in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. There is really no comparison between the rating of master
in the NRA and the rating of sharpshooter in the Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I am not sure whether or not you answered this question,
but do you feel that if the target was moving, rather than having the rifleman
move, there would have been a difference in aiming error, increased or
decreased aiming error&mdash;if the target was moving 5 to 10 miles an hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I think the movement of the target in this case would have
practically no effect on the accuracy of fire, because from the map we are led
to believe that the movement was primarily away from the firer, so that the
back of the President was fully exposed to the rifleman at all times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you explain your reference to a map? You have made
several references to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I refer to the survey plat which is dated December 5, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And how were you supplied with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. To the best of my knowledge, you gave it to one of the employees
in my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, this is a plat made by a licensed surveyor
of the area immediately adjoining the Texas School Book Depository. I
would like to introduce it into evidence solely to show the basis which Mr.
Simmons was using in his test, and not for the truth of the measurements
which are shown in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be received.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That would be Commission 585.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 585 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there anything you would like to add to your testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I think not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I wonder whether we could have a copy of your table?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. From your experience, Mr. Simmons, do you feel that with a
man who had been in the Marine Corps, with the rifle instruction he had there,
using this rifle, and what you know of the shots that killed the President&mdash;do
you think he was an extraordinarily good shot, do you think he was just
shooting in accordance with what might be taken to be the skill that service
in the Marine Corps would give him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Well, in order to achieve three hits, it would not be required
that a man be an exceptional shot. A proficient man with this weapon, yes. But
I think with the opportunity to use the weapon and to get familiar with it, we
could probably have the results reproduced by more than one firer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I think that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. One thing, Mr. Chairman. May I have this admitted as 586,
this table which Mr. Simmons prepared, from which he was giving testimony
earlier? This is "Table I, Hit Probability as a Function of Range and Aiming
Error."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The table referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 586 and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say proficiency with this weapon, Mr. Simmons,
could you go into detail as to what you mean&mdash;do you mean, accuracy with this
weapon, or familiarity with the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I mean familiarity basically with two things. One is the
action of the bolt itself, and the force required to open it; and two, the action
of the trigger, which is a two-stage trigger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can familiarity with the trigger and with the bolt be acquired
in dry practice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Familiarity with the bolt can, probably as well as during live
firing. But familiarity with the trigger would best be achieved with some firing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why is there this difference between familiarity with the
bolt and familiarity with the trigger in dry firing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. There tends to be a reaction between the firer and the weapon
at the time the weapon is fired, due to the recoil impulse. And I do not believe
the action of the bolt going home would sufficiently simulate the action of the
recoil of the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. One further question.</p>

<p>Looking at the figures for aiming error, as discounted by round-to-round
dispersion, how would you characterize the actual performance of men with
this rifle&mdash;that is, not the accuracy of the weapon, but the accuracy of man
and weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. I am not sure I understand your question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you feel on the basis of the aiming error, discounted for
round-to-round dispersion or including it, that this weapon is an easy one
with which to be accurate, or a difficult one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. It appears to be relatively conventional in that regard, I assume.
The telescope helps in the accuracy against a target which is well
displayed, as was the case here. And the weapon is reasonably conventional.
So that I think it would not be significantly different from any other weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. If you were having a dry run with this, you could certainly
make yourself used to the drag in the trigger without discharging the rifle,
could you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. Yes. But there are two stages to the trigger. Our riflemen
were all used to a trigger with a constant pull. When the slack was taken up,
then they expected the round to fire. But actually when the slack is taken
up, you tend to have a hair trigger here, which requires a bit of getting used to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. This does not have a hair trigger after the slack is taken up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Simmons</span>. This tends to have the hair trigger as soon as you move it
after the slack is taken up. You achieve or you feel greater resistance to the
movement of the trigger, and then ordinarily you would expect the weapon to
have fired, and in this case then as you move it to overcome that, it fires
immediately. And our firers were moving the shoulder into the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McCloy</span>. Thank you very much. You have been very helpful.</p>

<p>We shall recess now until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF CORTLANDT CUNNINGHAM AND JOSEPH D. NICOL</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 9 a.m. on April 1, 1964, at 200 Maryland
Avenue NE., Washington. D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Representative Hale
Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, and Mr. Allen W. Dulles, members.</p>

<p>Also present were Melvin Aron Eisenberg, assistant counsel; Norman Redlich,
assistant counsel; Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel; Charles Murray and
Charles Rhyne, observers.</p>

<h2 id="cc">TESTIMONY OF CORTLANDT CUNNINGHAM</h2>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham, the purpose of today's hearing is to take the testimony of
yourself and Mr. Joseph Nicol. We understand that you are a firearms expert
with the FBI, and Mr. Nicol is a firearms expert with the Bureau of Criminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
Identification and Investigation of the Department of Public Safety of the State
of Illinois.</p>

<p>You have both been asked to provide technical information to assist the Commission
in its work.</p>

<p>Would you raise your right hand and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Will you be seated, please.</p>

<p>You may proceed with the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, would you state your name and position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Cortlandt Cunningham. I am a Special Agent of the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And in what branch of the FBI do you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am assigned to the Firearms Identification Unit of the
FBI Laboratory, here in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is your education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I have a Bachelor of Science degree from Northwestern
University, and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Miami.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you briefly state your qualifications in the field of firearms
identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Upon entering the FBI Laboratory, I underwent an extensive
training course under the supervision of experienced examiners in the field
of firearms identification, which consisted of making thousands of examinations
and comparisons of bullets, cartridge cases, and weapons.</p>

<p>I have also done reading in the subject. I have done some research and conducted
many experiments in the field. And, of course, I have made thousands of
examinations on my own and testified numerous times in State and Federal
courts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How many years have you been in the Laboratory, Mr.
Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Over 5 years, and I have been in the Bureau over 10 years.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The witness is qualified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. To begin with, Mr. Cunningham, we had some testimony
yesterday on the bullet which is thought to have been fired at General Walker.
That is Commission Exhibit No. 573. Are you familiar with this bullet, Mr.
Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you supply the weight of that bullet, which was going to
be supplied to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I can. This bullet weighed 148.25 grains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does that show some weight loss, if the bullet was from a 6.5
mm. Mannlicher-Carcano cartridge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It does. Those bullets weigh 161 grains, but there is a
great deal of mutilation on this bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And could you tell us when you received this bullet in your
laboratory, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. It was received from the Dallas office of the FBI
on December 4, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And when was it examined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It was examined that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, I now hand you Commission Exhibit No.
143, and I ask you whether you are familiar with this exhibit, which, for the
record, is a revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. If you will excuse me, I won't open the cylinder. I have
checked the cylinder, and there are expended or fired cartridge cases in the
cylinder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which you have placed in it for a special demonstration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I fired it, yes, prior to my testimony here today. I have
seen this weapon before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again for the record, this is the weapon which is believed to
have been used in the murder of Officer Tippit. Can you describe this weapon
in terms of name, caliber and so forth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Do you want me to describe it as it is today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. As it is today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. As it is today, it is a .38 Special Smith and Wesson, Victory
Model revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And was it always a .38 Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, it was not. Originally this weapon was known as a
.38-200 British Service revolver. In this country the weapon would be known
as a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver, Victory Model. However, the
British gave the designation .38-200 to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was this revolver made in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And has it been in England subsequent to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And how can you tell that, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Well, first of all, all weapons going into England have to
be proofed. They are proofed at, usually, the Birmingham proofhouse.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They are tested for whether they will withstand a certain
charge. They place in the cylinders overloaded cartridges, and they are fired,
in the cylinder, as this one has been. It has been proofed to 3½ tons. Each
chamber in the cylinder has been proofed.</p>

<p>You can tell that, because each chamber has been stamped with the Birmingham
proofmark, indicating that each chamber in the cylinder has been proofed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, could you explain to us the difference between
a .38 S&amp;W and a .38 Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They are completely different cartridges. One cartridge
is a .38 Special, and the other cartridge is a .38 S&amp;W, or actually written out it
would be Smith and Wesson. It was developed for their weapons, and it 1s
quite an old cartridge, and it is known&mdash;usually as appears on a box of ammunition&mdash;as
merely a .38 S&amp;W. However, there are many differences in the
cartridges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you brought two&mdash;an example of each type of cartridge
with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I have. First of all, this is actually a Western .38 S&amp;W
cartridge. You will see the head stamping on the base of this cartridge
signifies it to be a .38 S&amp;W.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Before you go any further&mdash;Mr. Chairman, may I have this
marked as an exhibit&mdash;this specimen?</p>

<p>I am holding a cartridge marked Western .38 S&amp;W, and it is submitted as
Commission Exhibit 587.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 587, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. If you would care to see one broken down, I have one with
me. That is the same cartridge where the bullet has been pulled and the powder
has been dumped out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is also a .38 S&amp;W cartridge, but it has been disassembled
into a bullet and a cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct. The bullet has been pulled out of the
cartridge case and the powder removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this admitted as an exhibit?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be. What is the number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be 588.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It will be admitted as Commission Exhibit 588.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 588, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. This particular cartridge, which is one complete cartridge,
is a Remington-Peters .38 S&amp;W. These two components actually are of the same
cartridge. All I have done is pull the bullet, and it is also a Remington-Peters
.38 S&amp;W.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is the same cartridge as Exhibits 588 and 587?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct. The only difference is that they are
different brands. They were made by two different manufacturers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you show that to the Chairman for his examination?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. These appear to be lead bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They are, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The others appeared to be jacketed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They are not, sir. It is known as gilding metal. They are
copper-coated lead bullets. Actually, it is an alloy&mdash;it is not pure copper.
They have been flash coated, for sales appeal, more than anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does that coating serve to prevent distortion to any measurable
extent when the bullet has penetrated a body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, it would not, to any appreciable amount. It is such a
thin coat, as you can see. Later on I will show you the ones that have been
fired, and also the bullets removed from Officer Tippit's body. You can see
the coating comes off&mdash;it flakes off&mdash;it is very thin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that Exhibits 587 and 588 are substantially similar to
the R-P cartridge you have just been discussing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. They are both loaded to the same specifications,
even though there are two manufacturers. All commercially made ammunition
in this country is loaded to a specific muzzle velocity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this R-P cartridge which Mr.
Cunningham has been discussing admitted into evidence as Commission Exhibit
589?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 589, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You have been showing us a .38 S&amp;W, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have an example of a .38 Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I do. The first one is a Western .38 Special copper-coated
lead bullet of Western manufacture, a .38 Special. The other components I have
here are components of the same cartridge from which the bullet has been pulled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have the cartridge case, bullet, and cartridge admitted
into evidence as 590?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 590, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Cunningham, could you describe to us briefly the
<span class="locked">difference&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Do you want the Remington-Peters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You are holding in your hand a Remington-Peters disassembled
and assembled .38 Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you hand that to the Chief Justice? May this be
admitted into evidence as Exhibit 591?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 591, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This consists of an assembled R-P .38 Special and a disassembled
R-P .38 Special.</p>

<p>Again, I notice, Mr. Cunningham, that the R-P bullet has a lead-colored look,
whereas Exhibit 590 had a copper-colored look.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. The Western coating is known by the trade name
"Lubaloy." It is a trade name of the Western Cartridge Co., and it is nothing
more than a gilding metal&mdash;actually, it is just a flash coating on the outside of
the bullet. There is some advantage, a very small advantage, as to leading. But
it is mostly for sales appeal, because with Winchester bullets, some do and some
don't have the coating. Most of Winchesters which is the same bullet, have not
been copper coated&mdash;that they are selling today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, can you explain the difference in terms of dimensions
and contour, weight, and so forth, between the .38 Special bullets which you
have just shown us and the .38 S&amp;W bullets which you have shown to us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. The complete .38 Special cartridges, both brands,
they are approximately the same&mdash;they are made to specifications, and they are
within&mdash;just 1/1000th difference between the two of them. They are very close.
In some cases, there is a slight difference, but generally they are the same size.</p>

<p>The .38 Special cartridges are a little over 1½ inches in length. The .38 S&amp;W
cartridges are approximately 1.2 inches in length. In other words, there is about
4/10ths of an inch difference in their length.</p>

<p>The bullets of the .38 Special weigh 158 grains&mdash;both brands. The bullets in
the .38 S&amp;W cartridges&mdash;there is one grain difference&mdash;Western Lubaloy bullets
weigh 145 grains, and Remington's bullets weigh 146 grains, which is very close,
when you figure there are 7,000 grains to the pound.</p>

<p>The length of the bullets themselves&mdash;the .38 Special bullets are approximately
.72 plus inch. The .38 S&amp;W bullets are approximately .6 plus inch.
The lengths of the cartridge cases are also different. A .38 Special is approximately
1.15 inches for both brands. The .38 S&amp;W cartridge cases are approximately
.77 inch. And there you have approximately a quarter of an inch
difference between the lengths of the cartridge cases.</p>

<p>The diameters of the bullets&mdash;the .38 Special bullets, at the portion of the
bullet where the case is crimped into the bullet are approximately .357".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is the groove around the base of the bullet, also known
as the cannelure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, it is just above the two grooves, which are known as
cannelures, where the bullet is crimped. It is known as the crimp ring. It is
nothing more than where the case has been crimped in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I have pulled out the bullet from Exhibit 591, and there is
a little groove running above the second groove from the top&mdash;from the bottom,
the base, of the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That would be your crimping groove. Up at approximately
that area, both .38 Specials are approximately .357". However, the bases of the
.38 Specials, both brands, are about .350".</p>

<p>In other words, there is about 7/1000ths difference between the base and where
they are crimped, and both brands of .38 Specials seem to run&mdash;slightly undersized
at the base.</p>

<p>On the .38 Special the diameter of the bullets where they are crimped is .357".
The .38 S&amp;W Remington-Peters bullets run about .360", or just slightly less,
which is about 3/1000ths larger. Their bases, both brands, run about .356". In
other words, they run about 6/1000ths larger at the base&mdash;even though the
bullets are shorter overall in the .38 S&amp;W.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. To summarize that, in terms of the diameter, do I understand
that the .38 Special and the .38 S&amp;W have a similar diameter as you approach
the nose of the bullet, but that the .38 has a somewhat larger diameter at the
base than the .38 Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. .38 S&amp;W.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, why would the gun be rechambered from the original
chamber, which was designed for the .38 S&amp;W, to the chamber as it stands now,
which you tell us is designed for the .38 Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In this country, the .38 S&amp;W is not a popular cartridge at
the present time. In years gone by, many, many, many weapons have been made
for that particular cartridge. But they are usually the top-break, the cheaper
type of weapon. The .38 Special cartridge is a better cartridge. There is a
higher velocity and everything about the cartridge is better than the .38 S&amp;W,
ballistically.</p>

<p>The .38 Special has become popular in this country for revolvers. And the
reason it was chambered in .38 S&amp;W originally is because in England and on
the Continent it is a popular cartridge. The .38 S&amp;W in England is the .38-200.
They loaded a 200-grain bullet into the same cartridge case, and it was the
standard British Army load for this particular weapon and others. Why they
took that particular cartridge, I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was the gun rebarreled as well as rechambered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, it was not. The barrel of this weapon has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
cut off approximately 2¾ inches. The original barrel was 5 inches for this
model.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would the failure to rebarrel affect the accuracy of the
weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It should slightly, if you are firing .38 Special bullets,
because they are slightly undersized in a .38 S&amp;W barrel. On the average,
.38 S&amp;W barrels are approximately 4/1000ths larger than the normal .38 Special
barrel. In this particular weapon, that holds true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would it affect accuracy at close range?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. None whatsoever. And there, again, the shortening of
the barrel would affect the accuracy more than the use of .38 Special, due
to the fact that your sight radius has been cut down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is to say, when you shorten the barrel, the length between
the front and the back sights is shorter, therefore giving more room for error?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. In other words, the movement of the front sight
will cause more of a discrepancy at the target at longer ranges, due to the
shorter sight radius.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there any functional reason for cutting the barrel down
to its present short size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Sales appeal, I would say, is the main reason. Also,
concealment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In your experience, is a short barrel, cut-down barrel weapon
like this usually purchased for legitimate purposes by other than police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Possibly a collector. Among target shooters, it is not a
popular weapon, due to the short sight radius. Revolvers with 6-inch barrels are
very accurate weapons. A target shooter would not use a weapon of the short
barrel type. Therefore, it is not a very popular weapon for sportsmen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does the cutting off of the barrel increase the possibility of
concealment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It does, because it makes it handier. I carried, when I
was in the field 5 years&mdash;I carried my personally owned firearm, which had
a 2-inch barrel, due to the fact that for concealment you could not see it when
I wore a suit, and it was more discreet in the type of work I was doing.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Can both kinds of cartridges be used interchangeably in
this gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In this particular gun, yes sir. It makes no difference.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Either an S&amp;W or S&amp;W Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; the chambers of this particular cylinder have
been bored out, it appears from the very rough marks, to accommodate the forward
portion of a .38 Special cartridge. Also, when this barrel was made&mdash;or
the cylinder was made&mdash;the chambers had a shoulder or lip that the .38 S&amp;W
cartridge case would fit up against. The bullet would go forward farther, but
the cartridge case would fit up against this shoulder at the neck.</p>

<p>And in order to chamber a .38 Special, that forward portion had to be bored
out slightly, several thousandths to accommodate the longer cartridge, which, by
the way, is a very common thing on these surplus weapons. Practically all of
them are being rechambered, due to the popularity of the .38 Special cartridge.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, this weapon&mdash;was this weapon sold into
the United States after it had been used in England?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How much sign of use does it show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It has definitely been used, there is no doubt. However,
the cylinder is quite tight, and I would say that this weapon is in good operating
condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, since it was sold used, are you unable to attribute any
amount of use to the last user?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is right, you would not be able to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, could you explain briefly the manner in
which this revolver is operated, paying particular attention to extraction and
loading and reloading?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. First of all, the weapon has a frame into which
a barrel has been screwed and a cylinder which is hinged on a crane is also fitted
into the frame. There is a cylinder release on the left-hand side of this weapon
which enables one to push the cylinder to the left.</p>

<p>The cylinder has six chambers&mdash;in other words, it is a six-shot weapon. There
is an extractor rod and an extractor in the rear portion of the cylinder. When
you press on the extractor rod, either loaded cartridges or fired cartridge cases
may be extracted from the cylinder so that it may be reloaded again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Cunningham, in the operation of this weapon,
the cylinder takes six bullets&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In the operation of this weapon, when six bullets have been
loaded into the cylinder, is any action needed for firing except six consecutive
trigger pulls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct. You can fire this weapon either single
or double action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, can you explain the meaning of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. Double action is accomplished by pulling the trigger.
In other words, you just pull the trigger each time and you can fire this weapon
six times before reloading. This weapon can also be cocked, which puts the
sear on the step of the hammer and reduces the trigger pull, and may be fired
that way. This is known as single action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, if a person using the gun and having it fully loaded
with six bullets fired less than six bullets, can he use this ejector-extraction
mechanism without losing his unfired bullets as well as the empty cartridge
cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;by merely tipping the weapon. The unfired
cartridge is heavier, and will fall out of the cylinder into his hand. Then he can
extract the cartridge cases and load in more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you demonstrate that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. If I may have a cartridge, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have any fired cartridges in the cylinder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; I do. Prior to my appearance here today, this
morning, I fired five cartridges in this weapon, and they are still in the
cylinder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You are now placing an <span class="locked">unfired&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. An unfired cartridge in the sixth chamber of the cylinder.
Now, in a normal way, you would hit the cylinder release, push in your hand
like this, and tip it up. The unfired cartridge will fall right out into your hand,
due to the fact that the chambers of the cylinder are naturally larger than the
cartridge you are loading in there&mdash;for ease of putting them in. When you fire a
cartridge in a revolver, the case expands as wide as the cylinder. In other words,
when the firing pin hits the primer, there is an explosion in the primer, the powder
is ignited in the cartridge, and the terrific pressure will expand the cartridge
case to tightly fit the chamber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I would like the record to show that when Mr. Cunningham
tipped the revolver, the unfired bullet tipped out, but the five expended shells
remained in.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Cunningham, would you show how you would
eject the five expended shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. These are very difficult, by the way, to extract, due
to the fact that the chamber has been rechambered. And as you can see, you
get on your cartridge cases a little ballooning with these smaller diameter
cases in the .38 Special.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I would like the record to show that Mr. Cunningham extracted
the five expended cartridge cases merely by one push of the ejector rod.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. You won't be able to see it again, but when you eject a
cartridge case&mdash;later on for the powder pattern test, I will show that you can
have residues of unburned powder. That is what would happen if you ejected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
these cartridge cases in your hand. You would pick up unburned powder, residues,
and partially burned powder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham had ejected five cartridge cases from the
revolver into his hand, and his right hand is now filled with small black
particles, whose composition I am unable to determine.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That would happen any time that you did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; every time you eject them, these particles will come
out from the cylinder into your hand&mdash;unburned powder, partially burned
powder, and gunpowder residues.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Had you fired this morning these particular bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; at 8:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, these cartridge cases which you ejected
were .38 Special cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What time did you fire those bullets, those .38 Special bullets
in this revolver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. At approximately 8:15 this morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Let the record show that it is now 9:45. Now, Mr. Cunningham,
could this revolver be loaded on the run, or while walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you personally loaded a revolver like this while walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. And running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Does this revolver have a serial number on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you read that number to us, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. V-510210.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is this serial number unique to this particular type of weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. Smith and Wesson does not duplicate numbers. You
may have a similar number, but not with the prefix "V."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So this is the only such weapon with this serial number that
is in existence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct. As far as I know. I have never found
one in my experience, and Smith and Wesson does not duplicate serial numbers
in a particular series of weapons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Smith and Wesson claims not to duplicate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, how fast could one get off shots from this
weapon, shooting rapid fire, and without sighting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In a combat stance, that is crouched, with a gun at belt
level, and your wrist locked, you would have no trouble at all getting off five
shots in from 3 to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. With what degree of accuracy at close range?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Excellent. All FBI agents, for instance, practice at 7 yards,
which is 21 feet, and we are hitting in the "kill zone" without any problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How much training would one have to have with this weapon
to get four hits in four or five shots at close range into a human body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. None whatsoever&mdash;if you can pull the trigger and point
directly at a person, at 8 feet you would not likely miss&mdash;with one exception. If
you did not lock your wrist, there is a possibility you could shoot too low, or you
could pull to the side. Anyone with a little bit of knowledge and with&mdash;and
really grabbing hold of the weapon, would have little difficulty at all at that
distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say "lock your wrist," do you mean just pointing
the wrist so that it is in a straight line with your lower forearm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. In other words, to tighten it, and not be in a relaxed
position. By merely tightening the wrist, you would have no trouble at all
hitting a person, approximately the same distance as Mr. Eisenberg and myself.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I suppose a person who had the normal small-arms training
that he gets in the Marine Corps would have the ability to do what you have
just spoken of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Definitely, sir. As a matter of fact, with any training
at all with a revolver, I would say that he would hit 90 percent of the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is there a recoil action at all from this kind of weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; you get recoil. But if you have had any training
with a weapon of this sort, the recoil is not even noticed. The first time you ever
fired this weapon the recoil or the noise, might bother you. But if you have
ever fired a handgun, you don't even think about recoil. You automatically
adjust.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, you mentioned distance between you and
me earlier, a few sentences ago. Could you estimate that distance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Approximately 8 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. If there are no further questions on the revolver, I propose
to move on to identification of bullets and cartridge cases associated with the
Tippit murder.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I have none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, I hand you Commission Exhibits Nos.
145 and 518, which, for the record, consist of bullets, unfired bullets which were
found in the revolver and the pocket of Lee Harvey Oswald following his arrest
on November 22. I ask you whether you are familiar with the bullets in these
exhibits.</p>

<p>You are now looking at which exhibit, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Commission Exhibit 518.</p>

<p>I have seen them before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe these bullets very briefly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. They are cartridges. There are four cartridges.
Two are Western .38 Special with copper-coated lead bullets loaded into these
cartridges. The other two are Remington-Peters .38 Special cartridges, which
are loaded with lead bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you describe the bullets in the other exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Commission Exhibit 145 consists of one Western .38 Special
cartridge, which is also loaded with a copper-coated lead bullet, and the other
cartridge is a Remington-Peters .38 Special cartridge, which is loaded with a lead
bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I now hand you another group of bullets, marked Q-82 through
Q-86.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Eisenberg, would you state for the record at this time
what those two bullets are? They are introduced another time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes; all the bullets which Mr. Cunningham examined were
found either in the pocket or the&mdash;pocket of Lee Harvey Oswald&mdash;or the cylinder
of his revolver at the time of his arrest on November 22.</p>

<p>I now hand you another group of bullets marked Q-82 through Q-86, and with
certain other markings on them.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with these bullets? And may I state for the record that
the bullets I have just handed Mr. Cunningham derive from the same source.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am familiar with these bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you describe these briefly?</p>

<p>Before I do that&mdash;Mr. Chairman, may I have these bullets admitted into evidence
as a group, as Exhibit 592?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The articles referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 592, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. At this time, I shall have to leave to attend a session of
the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Commissioner Ford, would you preside?</p>

<p>And, during the morning, Commissioner Dulles will be here, I am told, and
if you leave, leave him in charge, will you, please?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham, thank you for your assistance. Glad to have seen you.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Warren withdrew from the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you describe the bullets in Exhibit 592, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; all five of them are Western .38 Special cartridges,
which are loaded with copper-coated lead bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that of a total of&mdash;you have examined a total of 11<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
bullets, and three are Remington-Peter&mdash;well, at any rate, of the 11 they are
divided 3 and 8 into Remington-Peter and Western .38 Special bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Cunningham, I hand you four cartridge cases in
an envelope marked Q-74, Q-75, Q-76, and Q-77. And I ask you whether you
are familiar with these cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham, before going on to the cartridge cases I just handed you,
could you explain when you received the bullets which are comprised in the last
three exhibits, and who you received them from, and how they were presented
to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. Commission Exhibit 145 consists of the two
cartridges that we received&mdash;the FBI received from the U.S. Secret Service.
We received them on December 3, 1963.</p>

<p>That is correct. They were personally delivered to the laboratory by Special
Agent Orrin Bartlett of the FBI, who is a liaison agent with the Secret Service.
And he delivered them to us on December 3, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And did he identify them in any way to you when he delivered
them? Did he describe their origin to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; he did not describe them to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. All right. Could you go on to the next group of five cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. I don't know the exhibit number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is Exhibit 592.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Commission Exhibit 592 was received in the FBI Laboratory
from the Dallas office of the FBI on November 30, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you tell us who you received them from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The Dallas office of the FBI. I have no first-hand knowledge.
I know that they were received from the Dallas Police Department&mdash;but
that was due to what I have read in an FBI investigative report. The laboratory
received them from the Dallas office on November 30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you go on to the last group of four bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Commission Exhibit 518 was also received from the Dallas
office of the FBI on November 30, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, for the record, I would like to state that to the best
of my knowledge the group of two and the group of four bullets, which together
total six, were taken by the Dallas Police from the chamber of the
revolver which is Exhibit 143, after the apprehension of Lee Harvey Oswald.
They were then split into two groups of two and four as we have them now,
two bullets being given to the Secret Service and eventually, as Mr. Cunningham
relates, to the FBI, and four bullets going to the Dallas office of the FBI.</p>

<p>The group of five bullets was taken from a pocket of Lee Harvey Oswald,
following his apprehension on November 22 and was kept separated from the
remaining bullets, I believe, merely because they had been taken from a different
source&mdash;that is, the pocket rather than the chamber of the revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham, returning to Exhibit 145, do either of the two cartridges in
Exhibit 145 bear any signs of having suffered an impact from the firing pin
in the revolver, Exhibit 143?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. An examination of these two cartridges, the primers of
these two cartridges, reveals no marks that could be associated with the firing
pin in Commission Exhibit 143, or any other weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are there any nicks on either of those cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. There is a small nick, an indentation, up near the
edge of the primer in the Remington-Peters .38 Special cartridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could this nick have been caused by the firing pin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. There was no indication, from an examination, that that
nick had been so caused by a firing pin.</p>

<p>First of all, it is in the wrong position, it is not in the center of the primer.
And, also, a microscopic examination of that nick gave no indication that it was
made by a firing pin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you microscopically examine the bases of both cartridge
cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, turning to Exhibit 518, consisting of four bullets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
which, as I mentioned earlier, were, like the two bullets in Exhibit 145, taken
from the chamber of the revolver, did you find any nicks in any of these bullets,
the bases of any of these bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Just by handling, there are bound to be small microscopic
scratches of one kind or other. But there was no indication that any of
the primers in these four cartridges had been struck by a firing pin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Were these also examined microscopically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They were, individually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say there was no indication that they were struck
by a firing pin, in your opinion, based on the construction of this weapon, if
the firing pin had been drawn back to any extent and then released, would it
have left a mark on one of the cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is&mdash;yes and no. It depends on how far it is drawn
back. As soon as the hammer internally clears the rebound block, the hammer
is then able to go forward and it probably would have fired. But up to that
point, the hammer is held back from striking, it cannot&mdash;under normal conditions&mdash;be
made to fire a cartridge.</p>

<p>However, it has been found with this particular weapon, a drop of approximately
3 feet on the hammer would fire a cartridge in the chamber.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. How far back does the hammer have to be drawn in
order to fire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That can be shown very easily by holding the cylinder.
By holding the cylinder, that distance can be seen, which is approximately 3/8 to
1/2 inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The witness is demonstrating.</p>

<p>The hammer, as he says, is going back about 3/8 of an inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Once you allow the cylinder to rotate, then the rebound
block is pushed out of the way, as you can see. Then you can cock the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you demonstrate for us the sound which would be
heard if you held the cylinder, pulled back, and then released the trigger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. A snapping sound can definitely be heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. There is a very audible snapping sound. Would that snap&mdash;that
amount of snap&mdash;leave a mark on the base of the cartridge case against
which the firing <span class="locked">pin&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Under these conditions it could not leave a mark, because
the rebound block is in the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say rebound block, this is a block between the
firing pin and the base of the cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; it is the block that is forcing the trigger to go
forward after it is pulled back. You see, your trigger will snap back. It is done
by a spring in the block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. To put it differently, this block would prevent the firing pin
from emerging from its hole?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct. That is exactly it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, could the firing pin emerge from its hole without having
traveled a considerable distance back? That is, to say, at what point does the
rebound block release the hammer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. At approximately&mdash;well, right there you can hear it. That
is a good half inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you pull it back and then release that half an inch
to disengage the rebound block?</p>

<p>(The witness did so.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. If the firing pin hit the cartridge with that amount of force,
do you believe the cartridge would be fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there any possibility it would not be fired? Any substantial
possibility?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It would still make a mark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. It would make a mark, at any rate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Let me clarify it. It still will not fire because the block
will go forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What will go forward?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In other words, the trigger has to be pulled through the
whole cycle in a <span class="locked">Smith&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In order to <span class="locked">disengage&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Either that, or cocked before the block will be out of the
way. When you pull the trigger and you don't release it or if it is in the cocked
position and the trigger is pulled and not released, the hammer will stay forward.
The firing pin will stay forward, so you can see it out through the breech face,
as long as the trigger is pulled. Then when you release the trigger, the rebound
block throws your trigger forward, so the weapon can be fired again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You are modifying what you had said previously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you do that upon closer examination of the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No; it is on the basis of trying to describe an internal
part without seeing it. If you would care to, I can show you what it looks
like. I have a photograph of the National Rifle Association breakdown. It
would be easier to explain if I could show you what I am referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Before you refer to this diagram, could I take a look at it?</p>

<p>Congressman Ford, could I have that diagram admitted into evidence?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be 593.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 593, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Eisenberg, do you want the whole article?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I think we might as well put the whole article in, yes.</p>

<p>(To Mr. Cunningham.) Perhaps it would be easiest if you came around
here, since the diagram is a small one.</p>

<p>Now, the diagram which you are referring to is on page 61, the second page
of this Exhibit 593?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Right.</p>

<p>As you can see, it is a diagram with the sideplate removed, which is this portion
right here. It is the right-hand side of the weapon. (Witness pointing to
revolver.) We are looking down on it with the sideplate on. These four screws
hold on the sideplate.</p>

<p>When you pull the trigger <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The sideplate is marked 20 over here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes&mdash;No. 20 is the sideplate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is in the diagram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No. 42 in the diagram is the trigger. There is a sear
arrangement on the trigger, attached to the trigger. If you cock it, the sear
arrangement will go up into a notch on the hammer right there, and hold it
back&mdash;right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is <span class="locked">number&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. You see, this is the sear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, could you use numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. No. 39 is the sear, and the sear is attached to the
trigger, which is No. 42 in the diagram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, we are referring to the first page of the exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. When the trigger is pulled on this particular weapon, or
if the hammer is drawn back, there is a notch on the hammer which is engaged
by the sear. When the hammer is back you have to pull the trigger to disengage
the sear mechanism from the hammer. When you pull back and it is in the
notch, that is known as single-action firing.</p>

<p>Also, No. 30 in the diagram is known as the rebound slide or block, and this
rebound slide is positioned right behind the trigger on an internal part of the
weapon. When the trigger is pulled, the recoil slide runs in a horizontal direction.
As you can see by the larger drawing right here&mdash;it is a small camming
action. It comes up, and is being pushed back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is in the middle of the second page of the exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Now, do you see the rounded portion of the hammer
right here, right in front of the notch?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is <span class="locked">No.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Number&mdash;on No. 42, the hammer, on the bottom, right next
to the notch that the sear engages, is a rounded portion. That is&mdash;in actuality,
this rebound slide acts as an internal safety, so the hammer cannot go forward
unless the trigger is pulled or it is cocked, because it is in the way. It cannot
go all the way forward, due to the fact that&mdash;right there you can see it very
plainly in the schematic numbered drawing on page 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The number you are pointing to is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is on the trigger, <span class="locked">number&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Forty-two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Not trigger&mdash;the hammer, No. 34.</p>

<p>By the way, on the prior 42 I meant 34. I got the wrong number. I was
referring to the right piece, but the wrong number.</p>

<p>But you can see this little&mdash;it is like a curved portion. It prevents the hammer
from going any further forward. The firing pin will not come out of the hole in
the breech face.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as you pull the hammer back, the rebound slide, No. 30, is out
of the way.</p>

<p>Also, when you pull the weapon through double action, that slide pushes
back, and your sear doesn't even touch the groove in the hammer, but it just
keeps on going right on through. In other words, you are pulling the trigger
strictly against the mainspring all the way. When it is on the notch, it is being
held, and the only pressure needed, is to take off the sear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Cunningham, to focus this line of questioning,
Officer McDonald, who has reported that he was in a struggle with Lee Harvey
Oswald on November 22d, while Oswald was in possession of this revolver,
has stated that&mdash;I am reading now from an affidavit, from a letter from Officer
McDonald to Mr. J.&nbsp;E. Curry, chief of police of the Dallas Police Force,
dated December 3, 1963.</p>

<p>He states in this letter that as he came in contact with Oswald, "I managed
to get my right hand on the pistol over the suspect's hand. I could feel his
hand on the trigger. I then got a secure grip on the butt of the pistol. I
jerked the pistol and as it was clearing the suspect's clothing and grip, I heard
the snap of the hammer, and the pistol crossed over my left cheek. I marked
the pistol and six rounds at central station. The primer of one round was
dented on misfire at the time of the struggle with the suspect."</p>

<p>Now, in light of your examination of this weapon, and your discussion,
could you comment on this statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I personally have fired this weapon numerous times, as
well as Special Agents Robert Frazier and Charles Killion. At no time did
we ever attempt to fire this weapon that it misfired. It operated excellently and
every time we have tried to fire it, it has fired.</p>

<p>It is very possible when he says that he reached across, and he grabbed it,
that he locked the cylinder, which I think any trained police officer would do.
You want to stop this cylinder from rotating. As soon as you do that, you
have actually stopped the hammer falling on a live round, because if the
hammer is allowed to go forward again, and it hasn't gotten into the cocked
position, the rebound slide, as I was stating before, would block the firing pin
from striking the primer of the cartridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. As I understand it, the cylinder is so interconnected with
the trigger, that the trigger cannot be pulled all the way back when the cylinder
has been firmly grasped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And if the hammer has not been pulled all the way back, the
rebound slide will not allow the firing pin to strike the cartridge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Officer McDonald's statement that the primer of one
round was dented on misfire: as far as you can tell, could this statement be
confirmed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; we found nothing to indicate that this weapon's
firing pin had struck the primer of any of these cartridges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, if the firing pin had struck the primer, it could only
have been after the trigger was pulled all the way back, under the discussion
you have just given us, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Or after cocking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Or after it had been cocked and pulled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; if it is in the cocked position, grabbing the cylinder
will do you no good; due to the fact that in the very operation of cocking this
weapon, the cylinder is rotated, and it is ready to be fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, in either event, the hammer would have traveled
almost to the outermost extremity to which it can go. That is, the hammer
would have traveled back all the way, whether it was cocked or fired in a
double-action manner. If that had happened, what would the likelihood be
that upon returning to the cartridge case, it would not fire the cartridge case&mdash;that
upon returning to the cartridge, the cartridge would not be fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. You mean actually the hammer had gone all the way
through its cycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I can only say that from my examination internally, as
well as having fired this weapon&mdash;I found no reason why you would get a misfire
with this weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, if a man had put his hand between the hammer and
the point at which the hammer enters, with the firing pin, into the breech
face, would that stop the weapon from firing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes and no. It is very possible that you can do it. And
it hurts, by the way, because the mainspring in this one&mdash;you can see the
indentation in my thumb&mdash;is a very strong mainspring. It would be possible.
You could put something in there.</p>

<p>Now, the question is when you pull that object out, would there be enough
distance and enough force to set off the primer?</p>

<p>That is quite a moot point, because you could grab the hammer and recock it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Apart from that question, would the man's finger or whatever
object he stuck in there be firmly fixed for a second or two, between the
hammer and the breech face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would he feel the impact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. He would definitely feel the impact&mdash;if he had a piece
of tissue of his hand in between. Now, if a piece of material, of course, went
between it which I don't know how it could happen&mdash;if you were struggling over
the gun, and he said he grabbed the gun&mdash;I don't know how he could have anything
except a portion of his hand, and I am sure he would feel it if the trigger
was pulled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Finally, if he had just grasped the cylinder, and Oswald had
pulled back on the trigger, could you demonstrate the sound which might have
been heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; you can hold it, and you get a snapping sound&mdash;if the
gun is grabbed away forcefully, and he would be really grabbing hard. So there
could have been an attempt to shoot and a snap would be heard. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The only thing which is unlikely is that the primer would be
dented on the misfire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. You would not get any denting if the cylinder was held and
the gun was jerked forcibly out of Oswald's hands. You would hear the snap,
but you would get no mark on the primer whatsoever.</p>

<p>The same thing he could hear if he jerked it out of his hands and he accidentally,
somehow, hit the hammer&mdash;you would still get a noise, a snapping
sound. But the firing pin would not come in contact with the primer of the
cartridge.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Because of the discussion we had a few minutes ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Using the diagram that was inserted as Exhibit 593.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. One final question. Officer McDonald says in this letter, "I
then got a secure grip on the butt of the pistol."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
Now, would that grip in itself in any way interfere with the action of the
pistol&mdash;the revolver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I don't know what he means by that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. If he means what he says, that is, if he got a secure grip on
the <span class="locked">butt&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. If he got a secure grip on the butt, that would take him
away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Take him away from what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That would take him away from the cylinder. If you
are fighting over a weapon, the first thing is to get it off of you and then get
hold of the cylinder. And then you can get both hands on the gun to jerk it
away. That is what I would do.</p>

<p>As I say, it is the way we are taught. You want to get the gun off of you first,
so you are not in direct line, and then go in and attempt to get it away from
the person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, suppose the gun was pulled away from Oswald as Oswald
had his grip on the trigger, so that he could not get the trigger through the
complete cycle. Would there be a snapping noise made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Definitely. If you locked the cylinder and jerked it away,
you would get a snapping noise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Suppose you did not lock the cylinder, but for some reason or
other the full trigger cycle was not gone through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Then you would also get it. It would be difficult, but you
could get it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How hard do you have to pull on that trigger in order to fire
the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. For double action&mdash;that is, without cocking, it is approximately
11 to 12 pounds, which is normal for this type of weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, I handed you earlier four cartridge cases in a plastic
envelope marked Q-74, Q-75, Q-76, and Q-77, also marked C47-C50. Are you
familiar with these cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am. I have previously looked at them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do they have your mark on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They do. Right on the side of each one, right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When did you receive these cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. These cartridge cases were received from the Dallas office
of the FBI on November 30, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, I would like to state that these cartridge cases
were found in the immediate proximity of the site at which Officer Tippit was
killed. They were found on the ground near the street where Officer Tippit
was killed on November 22.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. These are the ones that were found in the street near
the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, either in the street or in a lawn in front of a private
residence, or semiapartment house.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I see. In other words, they were possibly some of those
that were on the lawn in the front of 400?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes, sir; again, for the record only, since this witness is
unable to testify as to where they were picked up. The mechanism of this
revolver is such that the shells are not ejected until the user decides to eject
them&mdash;unlike a bolt-action rifle where the cartridge must be ejected where you
shoot from.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to have these four cartridge cases introduced
into evidence as 594.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The articles referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 594, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Cunningham, could you describe the make of these
cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Two of these cartridge cases are Remington-Peters .38
Special cartridge cases. The other two cartridge cases are Western .38 Special
cartridge cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you examined earlier six bullets which I told you had
been&mdash;six cartridges which I told you had been taken from the chamber of the
revolver which we have been looking at.</p>

<p>Those cartridges were divided into three Remington-Peters and three Western,
were they not?</p>

<p>(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that&mdash;or 50-50. So that the division is the same, the
division of the cartridge cases is the same, as between Remington-Peters and
Western, as the division of the cartridges found&mdash;which I told you were found
in the chamber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you examine the cartridge cases in Exhibit 594 in an
attempt to determine whether they had been fired in Exhibit 143, the revolver,
to the exclusion of all other revolvers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you tell us your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. As a result of my examination, it is my opinion that those
four cartridge cases, Commission Exhibit 594, were fired in the revolver, Commission
Exhibit 143, to the exclusion of all other weapons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When did you perform this examination, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. On November 30, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And how did you make the examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I first marked these cartridge cases upon receiving them.
There were four. I would like to state, first of all that Special Agents Frazier
and Killion also independently examined these four cartridge cases, and made
the same comparisons that I am going to state. I am telling you what I found&mdash;although
they independently arrived at the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The cartridge cases were first marked and examined for the presence of any
individual characteristic marks on these cartridge cases whereby it would be
possible to identify them as having been fired in a weapon. I then test-fired
Commission Exhibit 143, using similar ammunition, and microscopically compared
the four cartridge case&mdash;one at a time&mdash;that is Commission Exhibit 594&mdash;with
the tests obtained from the revolver, Commission Exhibit 143.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I hand you here two cartridge cases, and ask you whether
you are familiar with these cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And can you describe these cartridge cases to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. One is a Western .38 Special cartridge case. The
other is a Winchester .38 Special cartridge case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And how did you get possession of these cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. These were test-fired in Commission Exhibit No. 143, by
myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So these are the test cartridges you were referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That was a portion of them; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have these admitted as Commission
Exhibit 595?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. They will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The articles referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 595, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I also would like to state that we were test firing Remington-Peters,
also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How many test cartridges were fired, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. To begin with, three. And we have since fired the weapon
many times.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How many cartridges were fired by Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. We are going to get into that. This is a difficult question
which you are going to have to make a decision on. So I would rather develop
that slowly.</p>

<p>I notice that one of the cartridge cases in Exhibit 595 is split on the side,
Mr. Cunningham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is due to the oversized chambers of this revolver.
As I previously testified, the weapon was originally chambered for the .38
S&amp;W, which is a wider cartridge than .38 Special. And when a .38 Special is
fired in this particular weapon, the case form fits to the shape of each chamber.
And in one of those cartridges, the metal just let go. Normally it does not;
however this one particular case split slightly.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Does that have any impact on the rest of the operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir. As a matter of fact, I test-fired the weapon
originally, and I didn't even know it had split until I tried to eject it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You mentioned before, by the way, that there had been no
misfires with this weapon. Approximately how many times was the weapon
fired altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I would have no way of knowing exactly, but I imagine
we are approaching close to a hundred times by now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And no misfires?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. And no misfires.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Cunningham, did you take photographs of the cartridge
cases which you have just identified as having been fired from 143, and
the cartridge cases which are Commission Exhibit No. 595?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you make your identification on the basis of the photographs
or on the basis of your examination under the microscope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. My conclusions were arrived at strictly on the basis of
my examinations. These photographs in no way entered into the identification
and are strictly for demonstrative purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you show us these photographs, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Let's take them one at a time, and let's introduce them as
exhibits, one at a time. I have here&mdash;you have given me five photographs.
Did you take each of these photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. As a matter of fact; I did. I personally took these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And these are photographs of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They are photographs of the individual characteristic
marks on the base and in the firing-pin impression on test cartridge cases obtained
from Oswald's revolver, and also the marks on the base and in the firing-pin impression
on the cartridge cases, Commission Exhibit No. 594.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like these admitted, if you would,
as 596, 597, 598, 599, and 600.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 596
through 600, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Will the witness explain to the Commission what they
mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes; he will. Did you also make a photograph of the
breech face of the weapon, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I did. I didn't take this photograph. I was present when
it was taken. I have compared the negative with the actual breech face of
Commission Exhibit 143, and I found it to be a true and accurate reproduction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you show us that photograph? May I have that admitted
as 601, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 601, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you show us the area of the revolver which corresponds
to the area shown in the photograph, Exhibit 601?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. The cylinder was first removed to facilitate
the photograph. That is very easily done by removing the forward sideplate
screw, which is just above the trigger, which allows the crane to slide right out,
and the cylinder removed.</p>

<p>The photograph was taken from the right side, looking in toward the firing-pin
hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Just the way you are holding the revolver now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; just the way I am holding it now.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. With the cylinder removed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. With the cylinder removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, there is a cylindrical-shaped object in the center of
that picture, Mr. Cunningham. Could you describe what that is&mdash;right in the
center of the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is known by two different names. It is known as a
hammer-nose bushing, or a recoil block. It is&mdash;Smith and Wesson presses this
particular block in. It forms the hole through which the firing pin comes out of
the breech face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is, the firing pin strikes the center of the cartridge,
or the primer, as it is called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which causes the cartridge to fire. Now, what is the magnification
of the photograph of the breech face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Of the breech face, it is approximately 17 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. There are a number of markings or lines on this breech face.
Are these the microscopic characteristics which reproduce on the cartridge
cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And are the microscopic characteristics of this breech face
individual to this weapon, to the exclusion of all other weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This is your method of determining that a given cartridge
case has been fired from a given weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The breech face marks, as well as the individual imperfections
in the firing pin.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Let me ask a very elementary question, the answer to
which I used to know years ago, but I have forgotten. Just exactly what does
the firing pin do? What happens after that strikes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Well, it is easier to start with the cartridge itself. The
components of a cartridge are a bullet, a cartridge case, a primer in the base of
the cartridge case, and powder.</p>

<p>Now, the primer is made out of a very soft metal that can be dented. These
primers at manufacture are filled with, basically, an explosive. For instance,
Remington-Peters cartridges have PETN, which is one of Du Pont's explosives.
RDX is used as one of the components of Western cartridge cases, as well as
lead styphnate, lead azides, and other explosive materials.</p>

<p>When the firing pin strikes, there is a small explosion. Fire is given <span class="locked">off&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How does that bring about the explosion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is sensitive to detonation by a sharp blow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is, the primer is sensitive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; it is an explosive. To differentiate from the powder,
which is not explosive. Powder burns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, I have taken Commission Exhibit No. 591, which consists
of an unfired cartridge, and there is a round circle in the middle of the base
of that cartridge. Is that the primer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. That is actually a separate entity that has been
pressed into a hole in the base of the cartridge case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And that is more sensitive to shock than the powder in the
cartridge case itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. Powder is relatively insensitive. You don't set off
powder by a blow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But the primer is quite sensitive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is normally. I am talking about a normal blow.
The primer is very sensitive. I just named a few of the components, but there
are many other compounds in priming mixtures, which are considered secret by
each company. But I know that they are explosive mixtures. And the actual
striking of the firing pin&mdash;with enough force&mdash;causes a small detonation to occur.
The fire given off, goes through holes in the base, and into where the powder is,
and starts the powder burning. It is the gases that are given off when powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
burns, which actually cause the bullet to move forward&mdash;the pressure builds up
behind it, and the bullet goes forward.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That is a very good explanation. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, I wonder whether you could review the
pictures with us, and discuss some of the markings which you found in those
pictures that led you to decide that the cartridge cases shown therein have
been fired in the revolver we have been discussing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. The first photograph is a photograph of the breech-face
marks, the individual characteristic marks remaining on test cartridge cases
obtained from the revolver, and on the C-50 cartridge case that was recovered
from the scene. C-50 is on the left. C-15 is on the right. And the hairline,
the magnified hairline down the center separates the two cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, is the invariable procedure to put the test cartridge
on the right and the suspect cartridge on the left? Or at least is that your
standard procedure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I usually put the suspect on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, in the photographs at any rate, in all the photographs
we are going to see, the test cartridge is on the right, and the suspect cartridge
is on the left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Usually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what is the magnification of this photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is approximately 91 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you go on, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. On the left you will see the stamping, "SP", which
is in the cartridge case itself. And over here next to the hairline you will see
the individual characteristic marks. And you will see similar marks continuing
on the other side of the hairline.</p>

<p>On the C-15, the revolver side, you will see a dark portion running vertically
down through. That is the space that the Congressman was asking about&mdash;how
it fits the primer. That is the small space at the top where the primer
fits into the base of the cartridge. And over here to the right of that dark
mark you will see a lighter colored object with more individual characteristic
marks, that is actually the primer, the individual characteristic marks on the
primer of the test cartridge case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, as I understand it, in effect this picture can be viewed
as a composite cartridge? That is, the picture on the left begins where the
picture on the right ends, in terms of position on the cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In essence; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the point of the picture is to show that when you make
this composite, the lines on each case show up as if there were no composite
at all, but as if they were simply one case, because they are so close together
in microscopic markings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; in proximity. And they are brought together.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And so similar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What is the magnification again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is approximately 91 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are there any dissimilarities on the two&mdash;on the test and
the suspect cartridge cases, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; there are always dissimilarities. However, the
similarities so outweigh the dissimilarities that it is an identification. If there
are no dissimilarities, I would be suspicious that it would be faked&mdash;using the
same photograph and just cut and put together.</p>

<p>There are always dissimilarities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain why there are always dissimilarities when
the two cartridge cases are fired in the very same weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The metal is different; one cartridge case is slightly
harder than another; for some reason the cartridge case wasn't driven back,
upon firing, into the breech face exactly the same way. In other words, these
marks are reproducing, but you don't get exactly the same hit. It would not
be possible to get exactly the same hit time after time with different cartridge
cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What ratio of similarities and dissimilarities do you
have to have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. There is no ratio. Based upon the examiner's training and
experience, he comes to the conclusion that a particular cartridge case or bullet
has been fired from a particular weapon. As in this photograph, you can see the
dissimilarity is very slight. These are excellent marks.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was never any doubt in your mind, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You say these are particularly strong marks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. These are very, very, good marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, these marks are on the brass, so to speak, of the cartridge
case, rather than in the primer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; that is correct. Actually, it is brass, it is nickelplated
brass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that unusual, to be able to pick up such strong marks in
the brass as opposed to the primer of the cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is not really unusual; no. It depends upon the particular
weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you also examine the microscopic markings on the
primer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you found what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I could identify the weapon on the basis of the imperfections,
individual characteristic marks, in the firing-pin impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The firing-pin impression. And what about the area of the
primer around the firing-pin impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In other words, each of these three areas&mdash;the brass, the
primer, and the firing-pin impression&mdash;carries individually characteristic microscopic
marks which would be the basis of identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, you cannot make a flat statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. No; in this case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In this particular case, I knew at the time I was examining
it, all of the firing-pin impressions were excellent, and some portions of the breech-face
marks were. But you cannot say they will mark in exactly the same place,
due to the fact that these cases will mark in different areas, they are different
cartridges, they have been fired at a different time. You will get good areas, and
then in another area your marks will not be sufficient. In other words, it is just
the way the cartridge case was driven back at the time of the explosion in the
primer, and the bullet is fired.</p>

<p>They can hit slightly different, hit deeper on one side, be lighter on the other.
When a primer is set in a little bit deeper, it will not pick up these marks on the
primer part, whereas the firing-pin impression can be excellent&mdash;one portion of
the case will be excellent. But each one is a different examination. And many
times they will mark in different places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you show us the next photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. This is Commission document No. 597. This is
a photograph, photomicrograph, rather, of the breech face marks on two cartridge
cases. The one on the left is C-49, which is our number C-49, and the one
on the right of the hairline is a test cartridge case from this revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is the magnification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. This one was approximately 120 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is the magnification equal on both sides?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that true of all the pictures you are showing us today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. The negative is taken at exactly the same time.
You are photographing through a single eyepiece, with a focusable hairline down
the middle, whatever is on both stages of your comparison microscope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you turn that picture around again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. These marking are also on the brass, or outside of the primer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And again it is a sort of a composite photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, these markings seem a little less distinct than the
others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is in a different area. On this particular case, the
marks are excellent. You can see down in here some nice fine marks, and then
the heavier marks coming across there. They are good marks.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could you point out, as you look at the photograph, what
you consider good similarities, which would help you in the identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. Now, this is not the only point of similarity.
These strictly demonstrate the type of marks. There are many more marks on
these cartridge cases, all over the base of the cartridge cases, as well as in the
firing-pin impressions. But Mr. Eisenberg asked that we have a photograph to
demonstrate the type of marks on each particular cartridge case.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is only illustrative, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct. My identification was not based on this
picture. It was based on my complete microscopic examination and comparison
of test cartridge cases from the revolver with this particular cartridge case.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could you show me the similarities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. You see, you have your large&mdash;it is slightly out
of focus up towards this <span class="locked">end&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Excuse me, as you demonstrate this, could you mark with
circles and with a number what you are talking about, so when the record is
looked at it is clear what you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. All right&mdash;up here, near the top, you will find a very deep
ridge, which I will mark "1." As you are coming down, you will find another
real deep ridge, which I will mark "2."</p>

<p>When you consider this is 120 times, this is actually quite close together, except
it has been magnified&mdash;you have a set of marks resembling "railroad tracks,"
which I will mark "3."</p>

<p>You will find over here&mdash;you go down to your next step. There are similarities
in between there. The next big set of "railroad tracks" I will mark "4."</p>

<p>Then you move down, and you will find another similarity, four nice marks
down near the bottom. This whole area is similar. You are going out of focus,
but you can see these "railroad tracks." They are running along very nicely,
and that is being marked "No. 5."</p>

<p>The next photograph is a photograph&mdash;on the left of the <span class="locked">hairline&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What Commission exhibit is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No. 598.</p>

<p>On the left of the hairline is our number C-47, the cartridge case. On the
right is a test from the C-15 revolver, which is Commission Exhibit 143. These
also are breech-face marks in the base of the cartridge cases.</p>

<p>On the right you can see the space between the primer and the base of the
cartridge case, and also the individual characteristic marks in the primer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is the magnification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. This is approximately 123½ times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Congressman Ford, would you care for a discussion of this?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No. The one previously gave the basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Actually, this seems to be a slightly larger area. You
have again the same "railroad tracks," all up and down, going across the two
cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. To the layman that seems even <span class="locked">more&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Demonstrative, yes. I don't know if you saw the photographs
of the cartridge cases in the rifle, the assassination rifle. Those marks
are just as distinctive as the more demonstrative marks in this particular breech
face. But to a trained examiner, they stand out. They are harder to see than
those on these particular photographs. And even in these photographs, the
photograph you were asking me, they were not quite as vivid as they are on this
photograph.</p>

<p>But there, again, it goes back to what I told you&mdash;each cartridge case will
strike the breech face in a slightly different way, and you don't get complete
similarity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. To illustrate your point, Mr. Cunningham, I hand you Commission
Exhibit 565, which is a photograph, which was explained yesterday,
of the cartridge case fired in the rifle, and a test cartridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, this demonstrates it very well.</p>

<p>This is the very rough surface on the bolt of the assassination rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The bolt face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; the bolt face, and it is just as distinctive as these
striae on my photographs of the breech-face marks of the revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. By "striae" you mean lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; just lines. But it is more difficult to see, due to the
character of these marks&mdash;even though one type of mark is just as characteristic
as the other type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. As I understand your testimony, to the trained observer the
photograph shown&mdash;the cartridges shown in the photographs on 565 can be as
easily identified with each other as the cartridges shown on, let's say, 598?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But to the layman it is easier to see the similarities on 598,
with its striae, than 565 with its grosser imperfections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; due to the type of marks on each of the cartridge
cases, one is easier for the layman to see.</p>

<p>The next photograph is Commission document No. 599. On the left of the
hairline is our number C-48, the cartridge case. On the right is the test cartridge
case from Oswald's revolver.</p>

<p>Now, here you asked about what happens&mdash;somebody asked what happens on
the other side. Here you have the other side. In this particular cartridge
<span class="locked">case&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is the other half of the cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. In other words, you are seeing the primer, the
space between the primer and the brass on the cartridge case itself&mdash;on the
questioned cartridge case this time&mdash;and the base of the cartridge case of the
test is on the right. It looks like it is one. It is just the opposite side of the
cartridge case from the other photographs.</p>

<p>In other words, you take the photograph of the most demonstrative marks&mdash;which
look real good, naturally. The examination is of all the marks. That is
the big difference. And this time you will see&mdash;it is very demonstrative&mdash;on
each side of the hairline, a great deal of similarity between these marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the magnification here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is approximately 96 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. Why do you vary the magnification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The magnification of every photograph you take, sir, depends
on the length of the bellows of the camera. The microscope will have a
set magnification. But each time that you focus the length of the bellows
can change, which will increase or decrease the magnification. Also with some
photographs you mask off areas which are out of focus. You certainly would
not want to print a whole negative where you have distortion. You bring into
focus one small portion of the surface of that bullet.</p>

<p>If, say, one surface of the bullet is slightly flattened and the other surface is
rounded&mdash;the rounded surface will be going out of focus much faster than
the flattened side, and it would be very confusing. That is the type of thing.
You mask differently.</p>

<p>Then when you have the negatives enlarged, you can enlarge one negative
more than you do the other. So it can be based either on the length of the
bellows, or on the amount you have enlarged it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that all the photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, there is one more.</p>

<p>This photograph is a photograph of the firing-pin impression of the C-49
cartridge case, and the firing-pin impression on the test from Oswald's revolver,
and this is Commission document 600.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the magnification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. 120 times, approximately.</p>

<p>Now, here you have very distinctive marks, but it is much more difficult for
a layman to pick them out. That is the reason I have circled these marks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
numbered them, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, on each side of the hairline. On the left is C-49,
and on the right is the cartridge case obtained from C-143.</p>

<p>You have this very large, very distinctive imperfection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You are pointing to circle number 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In number 1. Also, in number 2, it looks like a little set
of railroad tracks, and this one with the same shape coming down through. You
can see this little piece and this little piece. Over here you have a real small
"railroad track."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is number 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is number 3. And it looks like a little hump or bump,
and that is very distinctive.</p>

<p>There is a slight overlapping here, but you can see it is sort of a <span class="sym">V</span> shape&mdash;in
number 4, very distinctive. Down here you have a <span class="sym">Z</span> line with a line through it,
number 6. I only brought those out to show six of the similarities. If you go
through you can pick out places in the firing-pin impressions, that are similar,
by yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. On the top of each of these photos, C-49 and C-15, there is a
large comma-shaped indentation, or comma-shaped mark. What is that caused
by, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is caused by a very large imperfection&mdash;a very distinctive
imperfection in the firing pin itself. And here it is.</p>

<p>Here I am looking at Commission document 601, the breech face and firing
pin. If you will look at the firing pin in this photograph, you will see over on
this side, this very large imperfection. It is like a facet&mdash;it is a flattened side.
It shows up in the photograph of the firing pin.</p>

<p>It is indented&mdash;since it is missing from the firing pin, it will show as a flattened
area in the firing-pin impression. In other words, what is concave on the firing
pin itself, will be convex in the firing-pin impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. If there are no further questions on the cartridge cases, I will
move on to the bullets.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Boggs?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Just one question. What you are saying is that there
is no doubt about the fact that the cartridges that you examined came from
this revolver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And, of course, there is no question about the fact
that this was Mr. Oswald's revolver. Is that so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That will be proved, I hope, before the end of the hearings.
This witness cannot himself testify.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I understand that. I am asking you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. There is no question, I don't think, about that. That will
be the subject of testimony.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I know&mdash;we are not following the exact rules of
evidence around here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. We will connect it up.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. In that connection&mdash;how many bullets were recovered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Four were recovered from the body of the officer. But as
you will see from the testimony which we will get into right now, that doesn't
mean four shots were fired, because there is a slight problem here. I would
rather have the witness develop it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You are being very mysterious now, but it is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, I hand you four bullets in plastic cases
marked C-251, C-252, Q-13, and C-253, which have also certain other markings
on them, and I ask you if you are familiar with these bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are your marks on these bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For the record, I would like to state these four bullets were
recovered from the body of Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>When did you receive these bullets, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The Q-13 bullet was delivered to the Laboratory the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
time on the morning of November 23d, and it was delivered to the Laboratory
by Special Agent Vincent Drain of the Dallas office of the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the remaining bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. By the way, it was returned to Dallas, and then it was
returned to the Laboratory, delivered again by Special Agent Vincent Drain,
of the Dallas office, also, Special Agent Warren De Brueys. They delivered our
Q-13 a second time on November 27th.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you say "our," what do you mean by "our"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In other words, to facilitate reporting in the Laboratory,
we usually give these items a Q or a K number. A Q number is a questioned
item, like a bullet from a body, and a known is a gun, the K is a known, like
a weapon.</p>

<p>That is for reporting purposes. But since this case began, we have so much
evidence, and we have received so much evidence, it was considered practical to
reassign a C number by us&mdash;like Mr. Eisenberg said, they are C-253, C-262, and
C-251. They also have a Q number. Q-13 is C-13. That is the reason why I
said "our" Q-13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When did you examine Q-13, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. November 23d, the first time. That was when I made my
examination. It was returned on the other date. But it was examined on 11-23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Q-13 has in it a brass colored object, as well as a bullet&mdash;that
is, the box containing Q-13, your Q-13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. That was identified as the button&mdash;the button&mdash;from
the coat of Officer Tippit. The bullet struck that button and when the
bullet was removed from the body, the button was also removed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Went right in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. I have no first-hand knowledge. But that is
what it was identified as.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like these four bullets admitted as
602, 603, 604, and 605.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. They will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The articles referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 602 through
605, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When did you receive what are now marked 603, 604, and 605,
Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They were received in the FBI Laboratory on March 16th
of this year, and they were submitted to the Laboratory by the Dallas office
of the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When were they examined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They were examined on March 17, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain the great time difference between the receipt
and examination of the first bullet and the receipt and examination of the last
three bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. At your request, you asked us to postpone the examination
of these three bullets in order to facilitate other examinations you wished
more expedited than the examinations of these bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now you are explaining the time between the receipt and the
examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, can you explain why these three <span class="locked">bullets&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Oh, between the first submission and the second?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes; between the submission of the first bullet, and the submission
to you of the second three bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Well, it is my understanding the first bullet was turned
over to the FBI office in Dallas by the Dallas Police Department. They reportedly
said this was the only bullet that was recovered, or that they had.
Later at the request of this Commission, we went back to the Dallas Police
Department and found in their files that they actually had three other bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, did you examine these four bullets to determine whether
they had been fired in the revolver, Exhibit No. 143, to the exclusion of all other
weapons?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you examine the four bullets which have just been marked
into evidence to determine whether those four bullets had been fired in the
revolver, No. 143?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And can you give us your results, your conclusions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>First of all, Commission Exhibit 602, which is our Q-13 bullet, I found to be a
.38 Special, copper-coated lead bullet of Western-Winchester manufacture which
had been fired from a barrel having five lands and grooves, right twist. I also
found the other three <span class="locked">bullets&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. <span class="locked">603&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. 603, 604, and 605, Commission Exhibits, which are C-253,
C-252, and C-251, respectively. I found that 251 and <span class="locked">C-253&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you give us the Commission numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Commission Exhibits 605, 603, they, too, were .38 Special
copper-coated lead bullets of Winchester-Western manufacture, which had been
fired from a barrel having five lands and grooves, right twist.</p>

<p>The grooves in the barrel ran in a right-hand direction, a right twist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That accounts for three bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>And Commission Exhibit 604, which is C-252, is a .38 Special Remington-Peters
lead bullet, which has been fired from a barrel having five lands and
grooves, right twist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Winchester-Western, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; that is <span class="locked">Remington&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Let's go over that.</p>

<p>We have <span class="locked">603&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. 602, 603, and 605 are your copper-coated lead bullets of
Winchester-Western manufacture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And 604?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. And 604 is a Remington-Peters lead bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, were you able to determine whether those bullets have
been fired in this weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>First of all, Commission Exhibit No. 602 was too mutilated. There were not
sufficient microscopic marks remaining on the surface of this bullet, due to the
mutilation, to determine whether or not it had been fired from this weapon.</p>

<p>However, Commission Exhibits 603, 604, and 605 do bear microscopic marks
for comparison purposes, but it was not possible from an examination and comparison
of these bullets to determine whether or not they had been fired&mdash;these
bullets themselves&mdash;had been fired from one weapon, or whether or not they had
been fired from Oswald's revolver.</p>

<p>Further, it was not possible, using .38 Special ammunition, to determine
whether or not consecutive test bullets obtained from this revolver had been
fired in this weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have an opinion as to why it was impossible to make
either type of determination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; this weapon, using .38 Special bullets, was not
producing marks consistent with each other. Each time it was fired, the
bullet would seem to pass down the barrel in a different way, which could be
due to the slightly undersized bullets in the oversized .38 S&amp;W barrel. It
would cause an erratic passage down the barrel, and thereby, cause inconsistent
individual characteristic marks to be impressed or scratched into the surface of
the bullets.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you say this weapon, will you identify what you
mean by "this weapon"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. This particular revolver, Commission Exhibit 143.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So this brings us back to your earlier testimony, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
gun had been rechambered for a .38 Special, which is slightly smaller in one
respect than the .38 S&amp;W, but it had not been rebarreled for the .38 Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>The original .38 Smith and Wesson barrel is still on the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that the .38 Special, when fired in that gun, might wobble
slightly as it passes through the barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I don't know if wobble is the correct word. But as the
bullet is passing down this shortened .38 barrel, we are probably getting an
erratic passage, so the marks won't reproduce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is it possible to say that the bullets were not fired from this
weapon, No. 143?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, it is not; since the rifling characteristics of Commission
Exhibit 143&mdash;this revolver&mdash;are the same as those present on the four
bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you said that there were three bullets of Winchester-Western
manufacture, those are 602, 603, and 605, and one bullet of R.-P.
manufacture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. However, as to the cartridge cases, Exhibit 594, you told us
there were two R.-P. cartridge cases and two Western cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that the recovered cartridge cases, there is one more recovered
R.-P. cartridge case than there was recovered bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And as to the bullets, there is one more recovered Winchester-Western
bullet than there is Winchester-Western cartridges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How would you account for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The possibility exists that one bullet is missing. Also,
they may not have found one of the cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Are you able to match the bullet with the cartridge
case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is not possible.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. So that while you can establish the fact that the
cartridge case, the four that we have, were fired in that <span class="locked">gun&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You cannot establish the fact that the bullets were
fired in that gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And you cannot&mdash;having the cartridge case and the
bullet&mdash;you cannot match them up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, you cannot.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. There is no way to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No; other than what I have said. In other words, you
can tell manufacture. But there is no way of&mdash;that I know of&mdash;of connecting
or identifying a particular bullet having been loaded into a particular cartridge
case.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. But there is no doubt about the fact that the four
cartridge cases came from firing in that weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They were fired in that weapon to the exclusion of all
other weapons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, when you said before that you would be missing a
bullet&mdash;under the explanation you gave&mdash;would you be missing both a bullet
and a cartridge case?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Excuse me, before you answer that question. What
testimony have we developed with reference to this delay in the transmission
of these bullets to either the FBI or to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Just what you have heard. Would you like to have it developed
further?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Well, is this within his competence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I do not think so. I can state for the record myself that
about 2 weeks ago I requested&mdash;I made a request of Mr. Conrad, who is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
Assistant Director in charge of the FBI Laboratory&mdash;that the three Tippit
bullets which had not theretofore been examined, be examined. At that point
they had not yet been sent from the Dallas Police to the FBI, and no request
had apparently been made for them.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Well, the FBI obtained one almost immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. And then there was how long a delay before the other
three?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You have the dates there, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The date was&mdash;we obtained the first one on November
23, 1963, and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. The day after the killing of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; it was delivered at the same time as all the other
material. And then it was returned November 17, 1963.</p>

<p>As far as the FBI is concerned, sir, we have no jurisdiction in that case.
We were doing the lab work for the Dallas Police Department, but in the investigation
of the death of Officer Tippit we do not have jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How did the Commission ascertain that these additional
bullets were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, upon review of the underlying materials, it developed
that while one bullet had been taken out of Officer Tippit as soon as he got to
the hospital, which was apparently the first bullet, the one examined November
23, three further bullets were taken out at the autopsy. And since we
knew that only one bullet had been examined by the FBI, and since we knew
at that point that three further bullets had been taken out, we asked that
those three further bullets be examined.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What proof do you have though that these are the
bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, again, we will have to connect it up at a subsequent
time. They were turned over to the FBI Dallas Office, were they, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I am talking about the three bullets now, not the
first bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes; turned over to the FBI Dallas Office by the Dallas
Police. Now, we will have to connect up by deposition or testimony before the
Commission on the origin of those bullets, and proof is not in the record now,
as it is not in the case of many of these items, as to origin. However, I have
no doubt that we will be able to connect it up and put it all in the record.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Has there been any inquiry made as to why there was
this delay in removing the other three bullets to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, as Mr. Cunningham stated, I was told since this was
not within the jurisdiction of the FBI, they would only examine evidence which
was given to them. And since it had not been given to them, they had not
examined it.</p>

<p>When I asked for it, there was a formal request made for them, and they
made their examination at that point.</p>

<p>Is that your understanding, Mr. Cunningham?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct, sir. In other words, we will do laboratory
examinations for any duly constituted law-enforcement agency upon request.
And we did it in this case. We offer our facilities but do not go out and ask for
work. Since we have no jurisdiction in the killing of Officer Tippit, we would
make no investigation and therefore, we would have no reason to go and ask for
additional bullets, until of course this Commission asked us to, and then we did
on behalf of the Commission.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Do you have any theory, and this is just a theory,
you understand, as to this discrepancy in these results as compared to the
cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Inasmuch as there are three Western bullets, you would be
missing one Western cartridge case, and one Remington bullet. You are missing
one of each. He could have missed one of the shots. I do not know how many
times he actually fired the weapon. But he could have missed once. It is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
possible that he could have. And depending on the angle, it would be very difficult
to find that bullet unless it struck some close intervening object. Also I
have no first-hand information, again, but I believe that some neighbor turned in
these cartridge cases to the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I believe that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. You have received a letter from the Dallas office of the FBI
just recently, I believe, setting forth that information.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That would account for one. There would still be
another one, would there not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. There would be just one cartridge case missing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is there any other logical theory which could explain the
results?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Of course, he could have had an empty cartridge case remaining
in the weapon at the time he fired it. Then he would only have fired
four shots, and then a bullet is still unaccounted for. That would explain it also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In other words, if he had an unejected R-P cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No&mdash;a Western.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You mean an unejected Western cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And he fired two Winchester and two R-P bullets&mdash;now in
that case&mdash;and, if he then ejected he would get three Winchester and two R-P
bullets, would he not&mdash;that is, cartridge case&mdash;if he had an extra cartridge
case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. If he had an extra cartridge <span class="locked">case&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. He would get five cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In other words, if he had an extra cartridge case, say a
<span class="locked">Remington&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I was right the first time. Suppose he has an extra Remington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Well, then you would have lost a Western. If he fires four
times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. And he has the fifth one in. You would still have to have
three Western cartridges loaded in and one Remington cartridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Which is four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But then you only have to lose one cartridge case. You do not
have to lose a bullet and a cartridge case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is right. You do have to lose one case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the case you lose would be a Western case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct. Western.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is it unusual to have a mixture of this kind in a pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. Usually they are all the same brand. Although
if you have two boxes&mdash;.38 Special cartridges come in boxes of 50. And you will
see hand-loaders once in a while. By the way, we found no indication that
they had been hand loaded.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Is this a police weapon as well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; and a very good one. Not in that particular caliber.
In other words, the <span class="locked">caliber&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That is what I meant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. .38 S&amp;W is not a popular cartridge in this country. The .38
Special is.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. .38 Special is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. That cartridge.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. With police forces?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We use it. Most of your larger police forces use the .38
Special. It is a better cartridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Getting back to the example we were using before as a second
possible theory&mdash;the cartridge case that would be lost would be a Western
case, I believe actually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, it would be a Western case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, also getting back to a subject we were discussing, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
quote in part from a letter from Mr. Hoover to Mr. Rankin dated March 31, 1964.</p>

<p>"On March 30, 1964, Mr. Eisenberg requested that the Dallas Police Department
be contacted to determine whether any additional cartridge cases had been
recovered." And I say parenthetically I mean in addition to the four which
we have seen here.</p>

<p>"On March 30, 1964, Lieutenant Carl Day, Dallas Police Department, advised
the Dallas office of this Bureau that all of the cartridge cases and bullets recovered
had been previously submitted to the FBI."</p>

<p>You mentioned or discussed the question of hand loading. Can you describe
what you mean by hand loading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Hand loading is nothing more than taking components
and by means of a press you make your own cartridges. You put them together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In this process, would you be able to take a bullet of one
manufacturer and a cartridge case of another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You said that you found no evidence that that had been done
in this case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We found no sizing marks on the cartridge cases, which
after the first time it has been fired, you many times have to resize it, due to the
fact that one chamber can be too large. They always full-length resize, for in
a police department many officers will be using this ammunition. You might not
resize if one were only firing them in one gun. In other words, you are limiting
the chambers of your cylinder that they will fit into. But normally they are
full-length resized, and from this you get these sizing marks. Actually they are
scrape marks from the sizing die.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In a hand-loading operation, is the equipment needed bulky
or small?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is quite bulky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. If Oswald had hand-loading equipment, would it have been
likely to have been turned up among his personal effects? Could it be easily
missed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. You could not miss it; no, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you say <span class="locked">bulky&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. A "C" press or an "O" press will stand anywhere from
10 to 12 inches high with a 2-foot handle. Your turret-type would run almost
a foot and a half high above the table. And they are all made very heavy because
of your full-length resizing&mdash;not only on your small revolver cartridges, but
for all your hunting cartridges&mdash;that takes great pressure. They are heavy duty.
And you need quite a bit of equipment. Most of the time there will be a case
trimmer, your complete press&mdash;there is a primer press, and then you have to
have dies for the cartridge you are loading&mdash;your sizing dies and your bullet
dies that you use to press the bullet into the cartridge case. Then there are all
sorts of sundry equipment that go along with hand loading&mdash;your powder
measurer, which is usually quite large if it is one that will do it volumetrically.
True, you can have a balance and weigh out a particular amount for each one,
but it takes an awful lot of time. Normally they are volumetric powder measures.
You tip it and it puts a certain amount of powder into the cartridge case.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is it expensive equipment to buy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Originally, yes. Comparatively so. A good press, I think
you can buy one anywhere from $29 to over $100. You will have to invest, I
would say, $150 to have a fairly good outfit. But over the years it is a cheap investment.
Instead of paying $2.80 a box, or $2.85 a box, you are turning out
cartridges, once you have your brass, for&mdash;even rifle, hunting cartridges&mdash;for
about 7 cents, and lead bullet cartridges down to around 3 cents apiece.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. $2.80 a box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I have the component list here from Western. I do not have
the cost per box of ammunition, but it can run anywhere from $2.25 all the way
up to $6 to $8 for some of your larger hunting rifle cartridges&mdash;boxes of 20 in
hunting ammunition, boxes of 50 in your revolver and pistol ammunition.</p>

<p>Even buying components, it is comparatively cheap. If you buy them by the
hundred, and they will run, for instance the .38 Special, 158 grain lead bullets
per hundred, only $2.80, and that is for original components. If you have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
brass, your powder cost is negligible&mdash;probably a penny a cartridge, half a cent
a cartridge for a .38 Special. So it saves you so much money if you are a target
shooter, for instance, it is advantageous to do it if you like to shoot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that a skilled operation, hand loading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Basically, no. Once you have the basic&mdash;if you do any
reading on it, and you take your time, and are very careful, it is not a difficult
operation at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, would <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How are these cartridges loaded mechanically&mdash;not
like this hand loading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is all done on large machines. They buy their lead,
for instance, in rods. They ask for a lead alloy of a certain hardness. Then
these machines&mdash;they feed in the rods in the bullet-making machines, and they
cut them off to length. They have different diameter rods. For a .38 the rod
diameter would be approximately .357" or .358". Then this machine comes
down in a swaging operation.</p>

<p>Another machine puts the knurling around&mdash;forming the lubricating grooves,
and another groove. They tumble out as fast as the machine can run.</p>

<p>Then you have your case formation. They buy their cases&mdash;they look like
little cups of copper. Actually it is a copper alloy. And then you go through
a drawing process, and then an annealing, and a drawing and annealing, and
a drawing and annealing of these brass cases. And then once you get them to
approximate length, you full-size them and form the cases. The machine keeps
tumbling them out.</p>

<p>And a small lathe&mdash;as these cases are going around&mdash;turns the case and puts
in the extraction groove&mdash;all automatically. Another machine comes up from
the bottom and puts the head stamp in. Another one is a drilling operation,
and it puts in the holes for the primer and also the flash holes into the case. All
done automatically. And they tumble into a big box.</p>

<p>Then they take those components and they put them on the line. The primers
are all done by hand, except for shotgun primers at Western.</p>

<p>There are girls sitting at these presses who do 50 or 100 at a time. They put
guide plates into the machine in which the girls put the primers. They are
automatically loaded. All the primers are put in by hand, in essence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, what is the advantage of hand loading in
terms of cost, if you do not have your own shells to start with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. There again your initial cost is fairly expensive. For
instance, for the .38 Special, unprimed cases, the list price per hundred last year,
was $4.60 a hundred. The primed cost $5. The primers cost 20 <span class="locked">cents&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So there is a saving even if you do not provide your own
shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Oh, yes&mdash;and the bullets would <span class="locked">cost&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How many primers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. One hundred. And 158 grain lead, .38 Special bullets
are $2.80. So $7.80 plus $2.00 worth of powder and you are in business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. For $9.80?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And how much would the bullets cost you if you bought
them commercially already prepared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I think it is $2.50 per 50.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, that is more. $2.25 per 50, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. $2.85? I never buy any ammunition of that type. I do
not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So for a hundred that would be $5.90.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I would say it is closer to $8 per hundred for .38 Special.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So it is cheaper to buy them that way than to buy the
components?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is cheaper to buy your components when you do not have
to buy the cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, now, is it possible that a gunsmith would buy the
components, including new cases, and reload together a case from Western-Winchester
and a bullet from Remington-Peters?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I don't think that a gunsmith would buy the new cases.
That is what I was saying. For instance, used .30-.06 brass, right here in town&mdash;you
can buy it locally. You can buy National Match Cases, which are excellent
brass. I think they are a nickel a piece; $5 a hundred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are they as good as the new cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They are once-fired cases. They are excellent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So in you opinion does the possibility that this discrepancy
in bullets and cartridge cases can be explained in terms of reloading make
much sense? Does it have a high degree of probability or a low degree of
probability, would you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you think it probable or improbable, in light of all
your testimony, that the discrepancy between the number of recovered bullets
and the number of recovered cartridge cases can be explained in terms of a
reloading operation of some kind, or hand loading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; I do not. It is improbable, because we found
no indication of any reloading operation. And in an examination of all the
cartridges that we had examined, there was no indication of a reloading operation
on those. They looked like factory bullets and factory cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And if you were going to reload, you would use used cartridges
rather than new ones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. You would use used brass, because you usually can pick
it up at ranges and places like that. You would not even have to buy it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. By that you mean you would use these? (Referring to
Commission Exhibit No. 595.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; well&mdash;these would be very difficult&mdash;in other</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; well&mdash;these would be very difficult on account of
the case. They would be hard to resize on account of the fact the case is pushed
out due to the rechambering. But they could be used; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say there is no indication, would there be an
indication if they were resized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; usually&mdash;unless the sizing die was extremely clean&mdash;usually
you will get your resizing marks from the resizing die.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And in particular you say the cartridge cases from this
particular weapon show a substantial amount of bulge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They do. As you brought to my attention, there is a crack
in the one case. I would not care to use this type of brass if I were hand loading.
I would find brass that had been fired in a .38 Special.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, by the way, the various cartridge cases, the four
cartridge cases and four bullets that you have identified, and that you obtained
from your Dallas Office and other sources, that is, Exhibits 594 and 602, 603,
604, and 605, are these now in the same condition as they were when you
originally got them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Substantially. A small sample was taken off the noise
which was run spectrographically. But the major portions of all these bullets
are the same as when they were received in the laboratory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you clean them in any way or alter them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; we had to clean them. They were removed from the
body and were bloody. You could not see the surfaces. We had to put them
in haemo-sol, which is nothing more than a material that will take out the blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that true of all four bullets? That is true of the last three
bullets as well as the original bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Q-13 was cleaned of blood tissue in haemo-sol. I do not
think I have anything in the notes that the last three were cleaned at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would that indicate they were not cleaned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I would say so, because I would have put it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was the substance removed from the first bullet tested to
see whether it was blood, or did you just assume it was blood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No examination was made of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Was there any dirt on the cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I don't remember any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would your notes show if you had cleaned it up?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And they do not show any cleaning up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You said these revolver bullets were sold in boxes of how many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Fifty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Will a storekeeper, a gun man who sells bullets, sell less
than 50 usually, in your experience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Maybe some small outfit would. But I just don't know of
any around here that will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Oswald was found with two types of ammunition,
two makes of .38 Special cartridges. Would you infer than <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What two types?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. R.-P., or Remington-Peters, and Western-Winchester.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. They were Westerns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you infer on the basis of your previous statement
that he had probably bought a larger quantity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The inference would be that he had at least two boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. At some point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; either that or he had obtained them from another
individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How about the rifle ammunition, this 6.5 Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle ammunition&mdash;how is that commonly sold&mdash;the Western brand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That would depend on the surplus house, how it is sold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You think that might be sold in less than fixed minimum
quantities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Many times that type of ammunition, surplus ammunition,
is sold in any amount. They will give a single price, single cartridge
price&mdash;or they will take off some if you buy them by the thousand or the hundred.
That is a lot different than commercially made ammunition for sale in this
country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like to examine this witness now
on the paraffin test, if there are no further questions on the areas we have
been covering up to now.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Any questions, Mr. Boggs?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Rhyne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. Yes; you said that you were positive that these cartridge cases
that were found near where Officer Tippit was killed, and which are over in
front of Representative Boggs now, were fired in this gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. As I stated the first time, in my opinion those cartridge
cases were fired in that particular weapon to the exclusion of all other weapons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. And with respect to the bullets that were found in the body
of Officer Tippit, you testified that you could not be positive that they were
fired by this weapon, Exhibit 143.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I could not identify those bullets as having been fired
from that gun. However, the rifling characteristics on the bullets are the
same as produced by that weapon. Also, I could not identify consecutive tests
obtained from that revolver, using .38 Special ammunition, and I could not
identify, even though there are microscopic marks on three of these bullets for
comparison purposes&mdash;I could not identify them with each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. Now, based on your many, many years of experience, is this
usual or unusual, that you are unable to identify bullets from such a gun
under these circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is not unusual in this particular case. I have had
other cases with these rechambered .38 S&amp;W revolvers, that are rechambered to
a .38 Special; it is not unusual to not be able to identify them. And especially
when the barrel has been cut off 2¾ inches, it even cuts down the possibility a
little bit more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. I was under the impression that you people down at the FBI
could identify almost any bullet as coming from almost any gun. That is not
strictly true, then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Thank you, but it is not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How much has this barrel been cut off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. About 2¾ inches. You measure the length of the barrel
from&mdash;you see the <span class="locked">cylinder&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. And the portion coming out from the frame, that is a
portion of the barrel. And the barrel is measured from there to the muzzle.
And the barrel now is 2¼ inches long. The original barrel was 5 inches long&mdash;or
at least it is similar to the model that would have a 5-inch barrel.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What is the advantage of reducing the length of the
barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Two things&mdash;sales appeal and concealment.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Does it affect the firing quality of the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It affects your accuracy inasmuch as it cuts down on your
sight radius. Your longer barrel will be more accurate than a shorter barrel,
due to the longer sight radius. The reason that rifles are inherently more accurate
than a hand weapon is due, in part, to the longer sight radius. That is
the reason the farther you can get away from the sight when you are firing a
revolver, the more accurate. Lengthening your sight radius will increase the
accuracy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. Based on your experience in your study of these bullets, do
you have an opinion as to whether or not they were fired by this gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; I cannot determine that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. You have no opinion at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The only thing I can testify to, is they could have, on the
basis of the rifling characteristics&mdash;they could have been. However, no conclusion
could be reached from an actual comparison of these bullets with test
bullets obtained from that gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. Even though there are a lot of similar markings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. There are not; no, sir. There are not a lot of similar markings.
They are similar. The rifling characteristics, are the same, or similar.
But, in the individual characteristic marks, there are not a lot of similarities.
There are not sufficient similarities to effect an identification.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Stating Mr. Rhyne's question negatively, these bullets
could have been fired by another weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct. Either this weapon or another weapon
which has the same rifling characteristics.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You are limiting that to the bullets now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. Yes; my question related just to the bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I identified the cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. He was positive about the cartridge cases, but not about the
bullets.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Now, would it be likely to find these cartridge cases,
which you can positively identify as having been fired from this weapon&mdash;would
it be likely that these bullets which you cannot identify as having been fired
from this weapon&mdash;would it be likely that they would be fired from another
weapon under those circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Well, that, sir, depends on other extraneous facts other
than my comparisons and examinations. In other words, I can only testify to
what I actually found from an examination and comparison of those bullets with
these test bullets from that gun. And as to anything else, I cannot testify. I
mean&mdash;that would be based upon other facts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Carrying some of these questions a little bit further, Mr.
Cunningham, you say that this bullet could have been fired from this gun, and
was fired from a gun with these rifling characteristics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which you said were five lands, five grooves, right twist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What about the widths of the lands and grooves? Did you
measure those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; they were also the same. In other words, when I
say it has similar rifling characteristics&mdash;the widths of the lands and the grooves
is taken into account the rifling characteristics. It has the same width and
number of lands and grooves and a right twist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, how many other&mdash;well, before I ask that, you have
also established that the bullets were .38 Specials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the manufacturer of each bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you say they had been fired therefore from a gun
chambered for a .38 Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; there was no indication that they were fired in a
weapon other than .38 caliber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that the weapon was a .38 Special weapon with five lands,
five grooves, right twist, and with the same dimensions for each land and each
groove.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, would the entire production run of this model conform
to that description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. And also there are other models.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Other models also produced by Smith and Wesson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; in .38 Special.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you estimate the number of those guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. May I have the NRA reprint? My estimate comes from the
figures that are set forth in Commission Exhibit 593, which states that by 1942
there were a million "Military and Police" revolvers, which is the prior model to
the Victory model, which they produced.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That is this model?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir. But the model has similar rifling characteristics.
You could not distinguish between them. In other words, one is a commercially
made gun&mdash;this is strictly a wartime gun. Also production of the "S" series continued
until 1948, when the "C" series was started, including over one million
"M&amp;P" models, including the Victory model, which was this model, were manufactured
between 1942 through March of 1948; and since that date, Smith and
Wesson has produced over 500,000 "M&amp;P" revolvers in the "C" series, which,
when you add them up&mdash;there are over two and a half million.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Two and a half million?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Over 2½ million.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, apart from specially handmade or equivalent weapons,
how many other types of weapons have you encountered which have these
rifling characteristics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Other than possibly a Spanish-made copy of the Smith&mdash;the
Smith is the only one in .38 Special now that will have similar rifling
characteristics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, when you say Spanish-made, you are referring to the
basement type of operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, this weapon did not produce, and does not produce&mdash;that
is, the weapon 143&mdash;does not produce identical microscopic characteristics
from bullet to bullet, you have testified. And you have told us that the reason
might be that the weapon was rechambered but not rebarrelled, so that the .38
Special is slightly undersized for the barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It has not been rebarrelled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That's right. So when you fire a .38 Special, it is slightly
undersized, and this might affect the barrel characteristics? Wasn't that your
testimony? That the .38 Special is slightly undersized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; approximately four-thousandths of an inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, could you therefore limit the number of possible weapons
from which the bullets might have been fired, not only to the 2½ million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
S&amp;W's which you discussed, plus the possibility of Spanish homemade weapons,
but also to those weapons, that subcategory of weapons within those 2½ million,
which does not produce microscopic characteristics such that you can identify
bullets fired from them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; you cannot, due to the fact that there was also the
possibility that the inability to identify consecutive tests from that weapon could
be caused from an accumulation of lead or from barrel wear&mdash;the barrel was
actually physically changing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is not quite what I meant. Out of every ten S&amp;W
.38 Specials, on the basis of your experience, how many do you think would
produce rifling characteristics such that you could identify bullets fired from
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Well, you could tell if the rifling characteristics are similar.
But as far as the individual characteristic marks, that would be on an
individual basis. Much depends on the imperfections in the barrel. Now, if you
have some real deep imperfections in a barrel, it would be possible to pick them
up each time. Even though you would have a lot of dissimilarities, the similarities
would be so distinctive that there is always a possibility you could identify
them. But not this weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Rhyne asked before whether it was usual or unusual
to get this type of weapon not producing microscopic characteristics such that
you could identify the bullet to the gun. You said it was not unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is not unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, I say out of every 10 such weapons, how many would
you expect to be in this condition&mdash;that is, in a condition such that you cannot
make an identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I would have no way of knowing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. On the basis of your experience, the experience that led you to
say it is not unusual to have this condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I can only say that you find them, that you cannot identify
them, so it is not unusual. But as to numbers, I could not say. When you go
back and you take all the hundreds and hundreds of examinations I have made,
it is not unusual. But I also will not say that it is usual. I will go to the negative,
I will say it is not unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you agree that out of the 2½ million possible weapons
it could only have been fired from a gun which will not produce microscopic
characteristics such that you can identify the bullet to the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. There is a good indication of that; yes. However, there
is mutilation on all four of the bullets. But the three we are talking about,
the ones that had marks for comparison purposes, now, even though the possibility
is remote, it is still possible that there is mutilation in different areas of
each bullet, so you would not be able to identify them. Even if the bullets&mdash;even
if they had not been mutilated, you maybe still could not identify them. In
other words, your mutilation on different parts of each bullet would preclude
the possibility of identifying them with each other. So I cannot answer your
question positively.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, Mr. Chairman, I have one subject remaining with
this witness. Mr. Cunningham, are you familiar with the paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you administered this test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give us the approximate number of times you have
administered it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I don't know the exact number, but I must have performed
this test at least 100 times, and probably more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, I will state for the record&mdash;I know you do not know
of this of your own knowledge, Mr. Cunningham&mdash;but a paraffin test was performed
on Lee Harvey Oswald by the Dallas Police. Three paraffin casts were
made, one of the right cheek, one of the right hand, and one of the left hand.
There was no reaction on the paraffin test of the right cheek. There was a
reaction on the paraffin test of each of the right and left hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
I will now hand you a sketch which was made by a participant in those
tests, which shows the distribution of the blue or violet dots which constitute
a positive reaction to this test on the left and right hands of Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Before you do that, Mr. Cunningham, will you describe
briefly the procedure on a paraffin test? I want to understand exactly what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The so-called paraffin test is the making of reinforced
paraffin casts, of a person's hands, and then treating either with either one of
two reagents. One is diphenylamine, and the other is diphenylbenzidine.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Is that when the cast is on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is definitely after it is removed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You actually make a cast of the individual's hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You make the casts. Then you take the casts off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. You slit it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you describe how the cast is made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. You first take warm paraffin. Each paraffin melts
at a slightly different temperature. What we were using in our tests melts at
about 130°. And this hot paraffin is placed on the hands. It is spread on with
a brush, or it can be poured over. If you are sure that your brush is absolutely
clean and will not react&mdash;and we checked all of our equipment so that we were
not getting a reaction from the diphenylbenzidine&mdash;we let it pour on from the
brush. Once you get a coating, you can just brush it on, because then you won't
be disturbing any materials on the hands. And after you get a coat on, you take
gauze bandages and lay them on top and put more paraffin on them. The gauze
does nothing more than to give it reinforcement so it won't fall apart or crumble
when it gets real cool. Then you cut them off the hands after they cool. Then
they are chemically processed with either diphenylamine or diphenylbenzidine.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. The cast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; the portion of the cast next to the hand.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Right. I understand now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you explain why paraffin is used? What is the action
of the paraffin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Well, the warm paraffin has the effect of opening up the
pores of the skin and many times material that you cannot get off from washing
will be picked up in the sticky paraffin. As it is cooling, the dirt and the foreign
material on the hands will become embedded in the paraffin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So the paraffin acts as a base to pick <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It acts as a medium in which the foreign material is
picked up from the hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you add the reagent, what is considered to be a positive
reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It turns a blue color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is the cast? When you say "it," it is the cast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Well, specks on the cast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Dots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, or an area of the cast. The theory of the test is
that it is a test for gunpowder residues. Now, that is the theory, and it is
fallacious, inasmuch as the reagents used in these two tests are not specific for
gunpowder residues. Now, it is true that the nitrates and nitrites in gunpowder
residues will react positively with diphenylamine and diphenylbenzidine, but
they are not specific. They will react&mdash;these two reagents will react with most
oxidizing agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give us a few examples?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. Urine, tobacco, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, soil,
fertilizer&mdash;I have a list here of the different families or classes of compounds
that will react.</p>

<p>In addition to nitrates and nitrites, substances such as dichromates, permanganates,
hypochlorites, periodates, some oxides, such as selenium dioxide
and so forth. Also, ferric chloride and chromates and chlorates. The list of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
oxidizing agents is so large&mdash;that will react&mdash;that you cannot specifically say it
was a gunpowder residue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Supposedly it is to determine whether or not a person
has fired a weapon. In actuality, in chemistry it is a good indication that an
oxidizing agent is present. The reagents have a valid use in a chemistry
laboratory.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Let me put the question this way. Given a dozen ordinary
people in the ordinary walk of life, what would be the chance of a positive
reaction on any one of these 12 people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Excellent, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Has the FBI performed an experiment to determine this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; we have. The early sets of tests we ran with diphenylamine.
And 17 men were involved in this test. Each man fired five shots from
a .38 caliber revolver. Both the firing hand and the hand that was not involved
in the firing were treated with paraffin casts, and then those casts treated with
diphenylamine. A total of eight men showed negative or essentially negative
results on both hands. A total of three men showed positive results on the idle
hand, but negative on the firing hand. Two men showed positive results on
their firing hand and negative results on their idle hands. And four men showed
positive on both hands, after having fired only with their right hands. That
was the first test we ran.</p>

<p>The second test&mdash;we used people who had not washed their hands in any
way. They were going about their duties during the day. Their hands were
soiled. Nine people fired weapons out of 29&mdash;20 people just had the casts made.</p>

<p>The first person fired a revolver. Both right hand and left hand were positive.
The second person fired a revolver. Both hands positive. A person fired an
automatic pistol, where you would not expect to find residue. Both hands
positive. Shooting with the right hand only, again one with a revolver and
three people firing automatics, all positive. Shooting with the left hand only,
one person with a revolver, one with an automatic, both hands positive.</p>

<p>Now, of the 20 people that had not come in contact with a gun&mdash;they definitely
had just gone about their business&mdash;every one of them showed positive tests on
either or both hands. A heavy smoker, for instance, would come up positive
in the area of the hand where you expect to find residues from firing a gun.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is the hand that you use for smoking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That's correct. And I noticed you with your pipe. You
are also sure to react because you touch the tobacco in your pipe. You do it
unconsciously. During another test we performed recently I did not know
that the diphenylbenzidine was on the corner of the cast I was trying to pick
up to wash off. I just touched it, and both my fingers which had touched my
cigar turned a blue color. That is how sensitive it is.</p>

<p>Now, of these 20 people&mdash;true there were some that had one hand that did
not get a reaction, but they all got a reaction, one hand or another, or both.</p>

<p>Now, recently in connection with the assassination we made casts&mdash;the three
of us, Special Agents Frazier, Killion, and myself, for neutron-activation. However,
two of the casts we treated with diphenylbenzidine. We obtained a cast
of the left hand after firing this particular revolver four times and reloading.
We obtained a cast of the right hand after firing that revolver four times, and
reloading. We treated both casts, fronts and backs with diphenylbenzidine.
This particular one was run on me. I washed my hands thoroughly with green
soap&mdash;and the green soap, by the way, did not react because we checked it&mdash;the
gauze used and the paraffin were all checked, to see if they would react,
and they did not. We found numerous, numerous reactions on the casts of both
hand. And I did not fire a weapon with my left hand. However, as I previously
showed you, when I demonstrated how you ejected cartridge cases, all of those
residues showed up, as well as, I am sure, other foreign material that the paraffin
removed from my hands. And there were reactions on both hands, fronts and
backs.</p>

<p>Now, theoretically, you should not find them on the backs over here, because
I had my left hand behind me, and you would find it on the palm. We found
reactions everywhere on the casts.</p>

Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It is 12:30 now. We will recess until 2 o'clock this
afternoon.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF CORTLANDT CUNNINGHAM RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are still under oath, Mr. Cunningham, so we won't swear
you again. Will you proceed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, I would like to take up a few things relating
to this morning's testimony and then we will go back to paraffin test.</p>

<p>First, I hand you two bullets and I ask you whether you are familiar with
these bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is your mark on those bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. On the nose; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you identify them to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. These are two of the tests that I fired from Commission
Exhibit 143, Oswald's revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. One is <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. One of them is a copper-coated lead bullet. In this case,
I know that it is Western, because that was the cartridge I used, and the
other one is a Winchester .38 Special lead bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have these admitted in evidence as
Commission Exhibit 606?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They may be admitted as 606.</p>

<p>(The bullets referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 606, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, using these bullets as demonstrations, could you tell
us how you determined that the bullets that were recovered from the body of
Officer Tippit, which you looked at this morning, and those were Exhibits 602
through 604, were respectively a Western-Winchester .38 Special and a Remington-Peters
.38 Special?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; however, I couldn't do it with these two bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Sure, use 602 <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The copper-coated lead bullet. I could use and I did use
it&mdash;I made a photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Before we discuss that further, let's see if we can mark that
for identification. Can you describe what is in this photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes. It is a photograph of four bullets. The first bullet
starting from the left is Commission Exhibit No. 604. As you can see right on
the label, it is Q-501, which would be Commission Exhibit 604. The next bullet
to it is a test bullet that I fired from Commission Exhibit 143, which is a known
158-grain lead bullet of Remington-Peters manufacture.</p>

<p>The third bullet in the photograph is our number C-253, which is Commission
Exhibit No. 603. And the fourth bullet in the photograph is this particular
bullet which you have given Commission Exhibit 606. It is a copper-coated
lead bullet of Western manufacture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take this photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I was present when it was taken. I compared the bullets
with the negative, and I can testify that this photograph is a true representation&mdash;an
accurate representation of the four bullets that were photographed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And this photograph is Commission Exhibit <span class="locked">No.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. If you will admit it into evidence, it will be 607.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 607 and
was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>(At this point Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, we have introduced a photograph, which is
Commission Exhibit No. 607, which shows four bullets labeled "C-252," "R-P,"
"C-253," and "Western."</p>

<p>Are two of those bullets the bullets which you just identified as Exhibit 606?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No; Commission Exhibit 606, the copper-coated Western
bullet, is the same bullet that was in this photograph, labeled the Western bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you hold that up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; that is the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The copper-coated or copper-colored bullet in 606 corresponds
with the far right-hand side bullet labeled "Western" in 607?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What about the lead-colored bullet in 606?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is a Remington-Peters 158-grain lead bullet. I do
not have that one with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This would be similar in appearance though to the bullet which
was photographed as the "R-P" bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, it isn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Because this is a Winchester.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why isn't it copper coated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The Western Cartridge Division of Olin Mathieson Corp.
loads both lead- and copper-coated bullets into their .38 Specials.</p>

<p>As of today, Winchester is only loading&mdash;under that brand&mdash;uncoated bullets.
That is what their latest catalog says.</p>

<p>Only Western is loading copper-coated bullets. They are both made in the
same factory&mdash;they are both made by the Western Cartridge Division of Olin
Mathieson Chemical Corp. in East Alton, Ill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So you didn't give us an R-P test bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I see. Did you use an R-P test bullet in attempting to make
your identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; you asked for our first two tests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I see. Okay. Can you show by use of that photograph, Exhibit
607, how you were able to determine that certain of the bullets found in
Officer Tippit were of R-P manufacture, .38 Special, and certain were Winchester-Western?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>First of all, in the manufacture of these bullets, each manufacturer has his
own specifications for how they are to look. By that I mean generally that both
manufacturers' bullets are similar. They are similar in weight. They are
generally similar in size and diameter as well as length. However, the number
and the spacing between the grooves&mdash;these grooves, the cannelures, are not
similar. It is actually a knurling process, you can see the knurling marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is the purpose of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Lubrication grooves. .38 Specials being lead bullets&mdash;in
order to keep down excessive leading they put in a lubricant&mdash;Remington-Peters&mdash;they
use a very dark heavy lubricant. Western-Winchester, they use
a very light-colored waxy type of lubricant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Up above you will see a small groove. It is nothing more
than just a slight groove. That can be caused when the case is crimped, the
bullet is crimped into the case.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is in the R-P?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. On both of them, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is on both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; you see one here, that has actually been put in. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
load up to that certain place and they crimp into that groove, which is known
as a crimping groove.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say crimping groove, do you mean the cartridge is
tightened around the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The neck of the case is tightened around&mdash;is crimped into
the bullet. The distance between the base to the first cannelure, and the width
of the cannelure, the portion of the bullet between the two cannelures, and the
width of the next cannelure, is individual with Remington-Peters bullets.</p>

<p>In other words, Western-Winchester bullets are not made with the same width
cannelures and the same distances between the two of them. Each manufacturer
prefers to have a certain distance between cannelures and a certain width of cannelure,
and it is strictly individual to each company. By these specifications&mdash;and
also another very important thing is the base shape&mdash;you can determine
whether or not a bullet is of one manufacture or another.</p>

<p>If you will take these two, one of the tests in Commission Exhibit No. 606, you
will see that the number, the width and everything about the copper-coated
Western and the uncoated Winchester are the same. In other words, they put
a flash coat of the gilding metal on the bullet and as I testified previously its chief
value is for sales appeal, and, a secondary value to prevent leading.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record again. Continue please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Cunningham, as of November 22, 1963, how many major
manufacturers were there in the United States who were manufacturing .38
Special bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. First, is the Western Cartridge Division of Olin Mathieson
Chemical Corp., East Alton, Ill., which manufactures ammunition under the trade
names "Western" as well as "Winchester."</p>

<p>The next major manufacturer is Du Pont, and they manufacture in their
Remington Cartridge Division ammunition under the trade names "Remington"
and "Peters," and the third manufacturer is Federal Cartridge Co. in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How many manufacturers of .38 Special ammunition are there
outside the United States, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I would have no way of knowing all of them. I know it is
manufactured in Canada by Dominion, and Norma also manufactures it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Norma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. N-o-r-m-a?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In Canada too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; it is in Sweden.</p>

<p>DWM in Germany must manufacture it, I am just recalling these larger
manufacturers that should manufacture it. Also, some English manufacturers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. How are you certain that one of the bullets found in Officer
Tippit was not manufactured by one of the foreign manufacturers, either one
you are acquainted with or one you are not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We maintain a Test Specimen and a Standard Ammunition
File, and we have foreign ammunition in them, although I don't think we have
all of the foreign. But we have never come across a foreign-made bullet with
the same physical characteristics as the bullets represented by those removed
from the body of Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you attempt to get a complete file of .38 Special ammunition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We definitely maintain an up-to-date file in our Standard
Ammunition File in the laboratory of all domestic manufactured ammunition as
well as some foreign, for instance, Norma and Dominion, and we have specimens
from other foreign manufacturers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you say that of the specimens you do have which you
feel are as complete as possible you have never come across two types which
are similar at least to these .38 Specials?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now Mr. Frazier yesterday said that the Walker bullet
seemed to be a 6.5 millimeter bullet or may have been fired from the 6.5 millimeter
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, had the same general rifling characteristics
as was found on that rifle which is in evidence as Commission <span class="locked">Exhibit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. 139.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes; 139.</p>

<p>Now do you have a complete file of 6.5 or a large file of 6.5 millimeter
ammunition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We have some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you feel it is as complete as your .38 Special file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No; I do not. However, we have never found any foreign
manufacturer manufacturing 6.5 Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition that was
similar to this.</p>

<p>From its general appearance, it has all the similarities of a western-world-manufactured
<span class="locked">bullet&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now this is <span class="locked">Commission&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. In other words, the knurling is typical&mdash;the physical characteristics
were similar to those of the bullets manufactured by the Western
Cartridge Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This is Commission Exhibit 573, which is the&mdash;as to which
Mr. Frazier has testified, and which is believed to be the bullet found in the
Walker residence.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you have examined it as well as Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you say that this bullet was a 6.5-mm. Western copper-jacketed
Mannlicher-Carcano bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. As definitely as you say the bullets which we have just been
looking at are respectively Remington-Peters and Western-Winchester .38
Special bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I see that just a moment?</p>

<p>What did that hit, the brick wall of the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I have no idea, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I don't know. I have no first-hand knowledge of it. It
is in essentially the same condition as when we received it in the laboratory,
and all I know would be what has already been furnished your Commission by
report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now given the fact that that was a 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano
cartridge, could that have been fired in any other 6.5-millimeter rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; it has to be a rifle that is chambered specifically
for this particular cartridge. In other words, there are other 6.5-millimeter
cartridges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, as I understand it, your conclusion and Mr. Frazier's
was only that this cartridge, that this bullet, could have been fired from Exhibit
139 or a rifle with <span class="locked">similar&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. On the basis of the rifling characteristics it could have been
fired from 139. However, there are insufficient marks remaining to determine
whether or not it had actually been so fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now the testimony yesterday as I recall it was that it was
fired either from Exhibit 139 or from a rifle with similar, or from a weapon with
similar rifling characteristics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But according to your testimony it would have to be similar
to a 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano rifle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No; I did not so testify. You asked if you could fire another
6.5-mm. cartridge other than the <span class="locked">cartridge&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I asked if that cartridge, if a Western manufacture 6.5-mm.
Mannlicher-Carcano cartridge could be fired in a gun other than the 6.5-mm.
Mannlicher-Carcano. And you said, as I recall it, "It could only be fired from
a gun chambered for that cartridge."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct. That 6.5-mm. Mannlicher-Carcano cartridge
could only be fired in a weapon that is chambered for that particular
cartridge. Further we have never found another cartridge that this particular
type bullet has been loaded into.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Have you any reason to believe there is another 6.5-millimeter
rifle manufactured that is chambered for that cartridge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. None that I know of. Maybe I misunderstood you. You
mean, if the weapon is chambered for a 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano,
then that is commonly known as its caliber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. But you can rechamber weapons for another cartridge,
as they do all the time with the military surplus Springfield rifles. You can
have them rebarreled and rechambered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Apart from rechambering, talking just about original manufacture,
do I understand that the only weapon which you have encountered,
the only 6.5 millimeter weapon you have encountered which would fire the
particular type of cartridge which is Exhibit 573 is the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; the various models of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Before the luncheon&mdash;are there any further questions along this line?</p>

<p>Before the luncheon recess we were talking about the paraffin test and we
were discussing the significance of a positive result, and you had given testimony
concerning two experiments which the FBI had run which indicated that
positive results might be obtained even by a person who had not recently fired
a weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. A paraffin test was also run of Oswald's cheek and it produced
a negative result.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do your tests, or do the tests which you ran, or your experience
with revolvers and rifles, cast any light on the significance of a negative
result being obtained on the right cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; I personally wouldn't expect to find any residues
on a person's right cheek after firing a rifle due to the fact that by the very
principles and the manufacture and the action, the cartridge itself is sealed into
the chamber by the bolt being closed behind it, and upon firing the case, the
cartridge case expands into the chamber filling it up and sealing it off from the
gases, so none will come back in your face, and so by its very nature, I would
not expect to find residue on the right cheek of a shooter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Would you expect to find residues on a person who has fired
a revolver such as Commission Exhibit 143?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. There again, by its design, you would expect to find something,
although there are cases where you won't find it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why do you expect to find a residue in the case of the revolver
as opposed to the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. A revolver has a revolving cylinder. There is a space
between the barrel and the front portion of the cylinder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I wonder whether you could show that by use of Exhibit 143?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. You can see when you close the cylinder, and each chamber
lines up, there is a few thousandths space between. When the bullet is fired,
the bullet jumps across this space and enters the ramp and then into the rifling.</p>

<p>The gases always escape through this small space. The loss is negligible,
but the gases are escaping on every shot. After you fire this revolver, you can
see residues, smoke deposits and other residues around the entrance to the rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
portion of the barrel which is next to the cylinder, as well as on the cylinder
itself.</p>

<p>So you would expect to find gunpowder residues on a person's hands after he
fired a revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do I understand your testimony to be that there is no
equivalent gap in the manufacture of a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you run any kind of a test with this revolver which
would indicate whether it did in fact leave residues?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; I did, or we did, three of us, Mr. Frazier, Mr. Killion,
and myself. The tests were run on me. I was the one who washed my hands
thoroughly. I did not use a brush, I just washed them with green soap and
rinsed them in distilled water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The purpose of this washing was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. To remove possible dirt from my hands. I washed my
hands. The gun was then wiped off with dilute HCl to get rid of any deposits
already on the gun, and I fired it in our bullet-recovery room, four times&mdash;and
then after firing I opened it up and ejected the cartridge cases into my hand, as
I showed you earlier today. The amount of residue that you pick up on your
hands from ejection of the cartridge cases was in my hand at the time.</p>

<p>I then, under ideal conditions naturally, went back and had paraffin casts
made of my hands and these were treated with a solution of diphenylbenzidine.</p>

<p>The results of this examination were that we got a positive result on both
casts, front and back. Many reactions in this area where I had ejected the
cartridge cases in my hand were noted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. By the way, you testified this morning that many common
substances will produce a positive reaction to the nitrate test, so-called paraffin
test.</p>

<p>Will the handling of an unclean weapon also produce a positive reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Just as much as firing it will. That is what makes this
test so unreliable. Handling a recently fired weapon, that is covered with
residues&mdash;you would get just as many oxidizing agents in the form of nitrates
and nitrites on your hands as you would from firing it and in some cases more&mdash;especially
up here and around here you would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Does the time between the tests, between the firing and the test,
make very much difference, within a few hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. If the residues are on the skin they will react. In other
words, if the material has been washed off completely, then you are all through,
but if it remains on the skin or is imbedded in the pores of the skin it would
still react, but so will so many other things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Just to review for a second your testimony this morning, in
the experiments that the FBI ran, a revolver or automatic pistol were used as
opposed to rifles, as I recall it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Were there any negative results following the shooting of the
revolver or automatic pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. None of those were negative results, but they were not
run under the same conditions. By the way, with an automatic pistol you
shouldn't expect to find any residues, for the same reason as with a rifle&mdash;the
cartridge is chamber, and the boltface comes in right behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you look at your notes for your first experiment, because
as I recall there were some negative results on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The only negative results were on the 20 people who were
run as a control and who had never fired a gun, and even for those people they all
got positive reactions at least on one hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I am talking about the first experiment now, not the second
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. The first experiment&mdash;yes; that was true. This test was
a little bit different.</p>

<p>In other words, they were not just taking people from their work. These
people had washed their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In other words, their hands were cleaned before they fired
the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But then some of them fired a revolver and still didn't get
a residue, as I remember your testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you make a test with the exhibit, with the rifle, 139, to
determine whether that left a powder residue on the right cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Will you describe that test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes; this time we ran a control. We were interested in
running a control to find out just what the possibility was of getting a positive
reaction after a person has thoroughly washed their hands. Mr. Killion used
green soap and washed his hands, and we ran a control, both of the right cheek
and of both hands.</p>

<p>We got many reactions on both the right hand and the left hand, and he had
not tired a gun that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This was before firing the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir. That was before firing the rifle. We got no
reaction on the cheek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Also before firing the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>We fired the rifle. Mr. Killion fired it three times rapidly, using similar
ammunition to that used in the assassination. We reran the tests both on
the cheek and both hands. This time we got a negative reaction on all casts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So to recapitulate, after firing the rifle rapid-fire no residues
of any nitrate were picked off Mr. Killion's cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct, and there were none on the hands. We
cleaned off the rifle again with dilute HCl. I loaded it for him. He held it in
one of the cleaned areas and I pushed the clip in so he would not have to get
his hands near the chamber&mdash;in other words, so he wouldn't pick up residues,
from it, or from the action, or from the receiver. When we ran the casts, we got
no reaction on either hand or on his cheek. On the controls, when he hadn't
fired a gun all day, we got numerous reactions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are there any further questions on the paraffin test?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Based on your testimony this morning, and what you
have told us in the last few minutes, why are paraffin tests conducted and how
extensively are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Many local law-enforcement agencies do conduct these
tests, and at their request the FBI will process them. They take the cast and we
will process them.</p>

<p>However, in reporting, we give them qualified results, since we frequently
will get some reaction. Numerous reactions or a few reactions will be found
on the casts. However, in no way does this indicate that a person has recently
fired a weapon. Then we list a few of the oxidizing agents, the common ones,
such as in urine and tobacco and cosmetics and a few other things that one
may come in contact with. Even Clorox would give you a positive reaction.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is this a test that has been conducted by law-enforcement
agencies for some time. Is it a new test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; the first test that I reported on here were conducted
in 1935.</p>

<p>There may be some law-enforcement agencies which use the test for psychological
reasons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Explain that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; what they do is they ask, say, "We are going to
run a paraffin test on you, you might as well confess now," and they will&mdash;it
<span class="locked">is&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I get your point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Following up Congressman Ford's question, does the FBI run
paraffin tests except on request from other law-enforcement agencies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We don't, no. Basically, the paraffin test is the preparing
of the cast. We don't do that. We will run the chemical processing of these
casts at the request of the local law-enforcement agency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. To rephrase it, if the FBI is having an investigation by itself
in a matter it has primary jurisdiction over, will it use the paraffin test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No; not the paraffin-chemical test.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is that because of the feeling that it is not as reliable
as it should be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. It is the feeling that it is definitely not reliable as to
determining whether or not a person has fired a weapon. It is positive, and
diphenlybenzidine solution is very positive and very sensitive, as to whether
or not an oxidizing agent is present and it is used in chemistry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You and I with our pipes would be in trouble here, wouldn't we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes, sir; I mentioned that this morning.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He brought it out this morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. I would be willing to state right now if we processed both
of your hands you would come up positive, because invariably pipe smokers stick
their finger in the bowl and you would get a positive reaction.</p>

<p>I am a cigar smoker, I also would come up positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I don't have any further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you have any further questions?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I have no questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. I take it in sum and substance that these paraffin tests are
practically worthless?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. For the determination of whether or not a person has
fired a weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. A gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Now the test is not worthless in chemistry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What use are they then except possibly from this psychological
angle that you have mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Are they useful in other ways than but for the psychological
reasons you mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. As far as whether or not a person has fired a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No. Even with the mere handling of this weapon I could
pick up residues. One could not testify that a person has fired a weapon because
he had residues on his hands, which I showed you this morning, for example.</p>

<p>There is a spot right there on my hand, and all I have done is empty the weapon.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did the FBI conduct a paraffin test on Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, sir; the Dallas Police Department did.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. The FBI did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We did not, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You didn't analyze it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. We did not. We obtained the paraffin casts and another
agent in the spectographic unit took them to Oak Ridge and had them subjected
to neutron activation, with which I am not familiar. But we did not do the
original examination and the reporting. I don't know definitely as to what the
Dallas Police Department did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. It was under the supervision of the Dallas Police Department.
I think a doctor performed the test, I am not sure whether it was a police
doctor or not.</p>

<p>By the way, after the paraffin test is run, does the positive reaction stay evident
on the paraffin cast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. No, it does not, due to the fact you have to wash it off.
The solution of diphenylbenzidine is 70 percent sulphuric acid. The solution we
were using in these tests was .25 grams of diphenylbenzidine to 100 ml. of 70
percent sulphuric acid, and sulphuric acid is corrosive. In other words, the
majority of the solution is 70 percent sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So the casts as they are now don't show anything except
white paraffin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You have no further questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murray</span>. No, thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Cunningham. Thank you very much,
sir.</p>

<h2 id="jdn">TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH D. NICOL</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Nicol, I am presiding at the request of the Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Will you kindly raise your right hand. Do you swear the testimony you
will give before this Commission is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, would you state your name and position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Joseph D. Nicol, Superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Identification
and Investigation for the State of Illinois.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you briefly describe your qualifications in the field
of firearms investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I began studying this field in 1941 in the Chicago Police Crime
Laboratory under Charles Wilson, remained there as a firearms technician
for approximately 9 years, and then moved to Pittsburgh, where I directed
and set up the Pittsburgh and Allegheny County Crime Laboratory, also working
in the field of ballistics.</p>

<p>Then I went to Miami, Fla., and set up the Dade County Crime Laboratory
and worked there for 5 years. I went to Michigan State and taught for 4
and now I am back in Illinois, in Springfield, as Superintendent of the Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you tell us approximately how many bullets and cartridge
cases you have examined to identify them or attempt to identify them
to suspect weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This would number in the thousands, I do not have an exact figure,
but our caseload in Chicago is approximately 4,000 guns annually, of which
we would make approximately between 10 and a dozen comparisons, so the
comparisons that would be conducted by myself or those under my direct
supervision would be approximately 50,000 a year. Now this is just a rough
figure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have any publications or lectures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I have one minor publication in the field of firearms. Most of
my publication work has been with the "Journal of Criminology" in the area,
of the technical note and abstract section.</p>

<p>I do not have any major publications in the firearms field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is your association with that Journal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I am associate editor of the "Journal of Criminal Law and
Criminology."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you lecture on any regular basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. At the present time I am lecturing with the University of Illinois
in criminal investigation, at the Chicago campus, and prior to that I had been
on the staff at Michigan State University for approximately 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your education before you went into this field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from Northwestern,
and during the period that I was with the Chicago Crime Laboratory
I got a Master's in Physics also from Northwestern.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like permission to take Mr. Nicol's
testimony as an expert witness in the field of firearms identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You may proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Nicol, I will hand you 3 exhibits, 3 items, Commission
Exhibits 399, 567, and 569, which I will describe for the record as
being a bullet and 2 bullet fragments, and I ask you whether you are familiar
with those 3 Commission Exhibits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. May I examine them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes, you may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, this was the exhibit that was given to me as Q-1 in the
original transmission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This being which Commission exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This being 399.</p>

<p>Exhibit 567, this was referred to as Q-2, and also accompanied the other
exhibit.</p>

<p>Commission Exhibit 569, this is Q-3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are your marks on those exhibits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, I have marked my initials on an unrifled portion of each
one of these exhibits. There were also other marks on it at the time I received
the specimens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I don't know whether you gentlemen have seen these. These
are rifle bullets and bullet fragments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is this the one that was found on the stretcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Exhibit 399 is the bullet that was found on the stretcher.
Exhibits 567 and 569 were found in the front portion of the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. These are pretty badly mutilated, aren't they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Apparently they are separated so that one can't tell whether they
come from a single bullet or from two separate projectiles. One is a nose portion
and the other is a base.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is this the one that is the nose portion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You are handing, Mr. Dulles is handing Mr. Nicol Commission
Exhibit 569.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, that would be the base portion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is what I thought. Are those different parts of the same
bullet possibly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. That is possible, because there appears to be an interval of approximately
an eighth of an inch that is not present, so that the area where one
begins is not even with the other, so it is not possible to tell, at least I couldn't
to express an opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is, they might be two separate bullets or two parts of
the same bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Two parts of the same or separate bullets that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I hand you Commission Exhibit 572, which for the record
consists of two bullets, and ask you whether you are familiar with those bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. These are the two projectiles which were given to me as K-1, and
were used by me as standards or tests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, when you say "standards or tests," could you amplify
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. On the basis of information on the cartridge, or on the envelope,
rather, it was my understanding that these had been fired from a weapon.
I have not any personal knowledge of the weapon from which they were fired, but
they were used as comparison standards to be compared against rifling impressions
on the other three exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you tell us how you obtained these four exhibits which
you have just looked at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. All these exhibits were obtained from Mr. Eisenberg on March 24,
here in this office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And for the record, I obtained these items from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, and transmitted them directly to Mr. Nicol for his
examination.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Nicol, you therefore did not fire the two test bullets which you
used in your comparison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And can you go into that at any length as to&mdash;do you have
any reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Well, probably two very basic reasons. One, the matter of time,
and secondly the fact that I did not have facilities in the area where I was
working for the collection of such tests from a high-powered weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
There is the other problem, as developed later, it was apparent that the weapon,
even in the firing of this small sequence, was undergoing some changes, and it
was my understanding that several shots had been fired since these tests were
fired and there might be some likelihood of transitory changes which would make
these the best specimens rather than those I might fire now after this series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again for the record, I had been informed by the FBI that
some 50 or more bullets had been fired from the rifle, and that the firing of this
many bullets from a high-velocity weapon would seriously alter the characteristics
of the barrel.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Would that be your conclusion, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, it would be. It has been my experience that there is a rapid
erosion with the high pressures and high temperatures that are involved in a
weapon of that velocity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Nicol, did you examine the three exhibits which
were given to you as Q-1, Q-2, and Q-3, and which are now, I believe 567, 569,
and <span class="locked">399&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. To determine whether or not they had come from the identical
barrel as that in which the two&mdash;the bullets in Exhibit 572 had sheen fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Can you give us your conclusions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes. It is my opinion that the same weapon that fired Commission's
Exhibit 572 also fired the projectiles in Commission's Exhibits 569, 567,
and 399.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That would be to the exclusion of all other weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take photographs of the test and suspect items?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Under the comparison microscope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And have you brought those photographs with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>I might say in passing that this was done in Philadelphia with equipment that
I was not thoroughly conversant with, that is, a type that I have used, but each
piece has some idiosyncrasy, and considering the time element I do not offer
these as the best quality that could be produced under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Does that make any difference in your judgment or
opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, sir; it doesn't, because my opinion is based upon a visual
examination. That is, photography is not an integral part of arriving at the
conclusion, except in one facet which I will discuss later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. On that subject, have you testified in court on firearms
identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you usually use photographs when you testify?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No. As a matter of fact, I can't recall an instance in which I
have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And why were these prepared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. These were prepared at your request so that there would be
documentary evidence of what I was observing. However&mdash;and this one, for
example, will serve to illustrate the type of photography that is involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Excuse me a second.</p>

<p>You are holding up a photograph labeled Q-1, K-1. Did you take that photograph,
Mr. Nicol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, this was taken under a comparison microscope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And Q-1 is one of the bullets which I have called the suspect
bullets, and K-1 is the test bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, Q-1 would be 399, and K-1 would be one of the projectiles in
572.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this photograph admitted as
Commission Exhibit No. 608?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 608 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Using this photograph, Mr. Nicol, could you explain some of
the markings which led you to the conclusion that Q-1 or Exhibit 399 had
been fired from the same barrel through which K-1 was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Before you do that, just for an amateur, would you explain what
this is a photograph of, the inside of the barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, this is a photograph of two projectiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Projectiles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This is the dividing line of the comparison bridge actually. You
see a portion of one, of K-1 on one side and Q-1 on the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is that groove on the right a cannelure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. There is a cannelure, that would be the position at which the
projectile is crimped and held in the cartridge case.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Why wouldn't that show on Q-1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It would be over here on the other side. You see you only see this
much of Q-1, and it may show on Q-1, but it will be over underneath, and
you only see this much of it&mdash;in half the field.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This is an overlay in effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. In a sense, yes, and you are actually masking off half of each
one that is represented over here, and masking off half of the K-1 over here.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is the magnification of these photographs, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. These were taken on five by seven, I would estimate about 30
diameter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And is the magnification of Q-1 the same as the magnification
of K-1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; the optics are carefully matched in order that they
magnify identically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Will that statement be true of all the comparison photographs
that will be shown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir. They may not be at the same magnification because I
took some of the subsequent ones on a different unit which had different optics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But the left and right side of the pictures would be at the
same magnification as each other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. They will be at matched magnification, correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Why don't you continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Starting up at the top you will notice a white patch which represents
a land impression on the two projectiles. Immediately below that a large
patch with a similarity of the contours of the edges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, do you think you could circle that and mark it
"1" so that people looking at the record in the future will know what you are
referring to? Circle it or make an arrow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Below that in approximately this position you will see a line on Q-1 that is
found over in the comparable position on K-1.</p>

<p>Below that at a point representing an imperfection on Q-1, slight damage to
the projectile, you will notice a line which continues across.</p>

<p>Below that a pair of lines, and then a larger line, below that a pair of
fairly deep impressions, and below that another pair of single broad grooves,
and then another pair, one of the lines is not in the same size, and then as one
gets further down the match is&mdash;the bullets are no longer in a match relationship,
simply because Q-1 is somewhat distorted as a result of having struck some
hard object at the base portion, so that it is oval.</p>

<p>In the case here we are comparing two surfaces of different radii so that
they do not&mdash;looking at them as a projection they do not match up.</p>

<p>But in this particular region, from approximately this fill-in in the cannelure,
there is a sufficient number of points of identification to lead me to the conclusion
they were both fired in the same weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you mark that, that you mention as "2"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This again, at least the "Q" part of this, is the bullet that was
found in the stretcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; this specimen here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is on the left-hand side, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. "Q," as Mr. Cunningham stated, is the FBI mark for "questioned,"
whereas "K" is the FBI mark for "known."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I retained the same nomenclature so I would not add any unnecessary
marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now do you have another photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes. I took three different positions of Q-1 and K-1. This would
be now with the same projectiles under the comparison microscope but rotated
to a new position. Each one of these positions shows a similar rotation.</p>

<p>Do you want to mark these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This photograph was also taken by you, Mr. Nicol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have this admitted as 609?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It shall be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 609, and was
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This is also marked Q-1 and K-1.</p>

<p>That will be Commission Exhibit 609.</p>

<p>Would you discuss that photograph briefly, Mr. Nicol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This represents a new position of Q-1 and K-1 in a match relationship.
Both have been rotated simultaneously through the same angle, and
looking at the bottom this time, the large broad area represents a land impression.</p>

<p>Then coming up to a point approximately a half inch above the land edge
there is a deep groove paired up with several other deep indentations. These
are worth noting because these represented very prominent index marks on
both Q-1, Q-2, and Q-3. This was used as, you might say, a point of departure
in lining up the projectiles. And again this shows what I would consider
evidence of similarity between the rifling impressions on both projectiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You wouldn't go further than that&mdash;"evidence of similarity"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Well, I would go so far as to say that based upon the individual
characteristics that I observed, these, plus those shown on the other photograph,
would lead me to the opinion that they were fired in the same gun.</p>

<p>When I refer to similarities, these would be individual characteristics which
would be in the same category as the individual points of identification on a
fingerprint. This would be tantamount to the fingerprint of that particular
weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. This is the third photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This is a third photograph of another very prominent mark on
both projectiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Taken by you, Mr. Nicol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have this admitted as Commission Exhibit 610?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 610 and was
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Representative Ford (addressing Mr. Eisenberg). Now both Q-1 and K-1
were fired from the Commission Exhibit 139?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. 139, yes. The FBI fired K-1 from Exhibit 139.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicol has now identified Q-1 as having been fired from the same source as
K-1, and, therefore, from Exhibit 139.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This represents a third position of Q-1 and K-1, and in this third
position, of course, the first two positions still are in match relationship, that
is to say in a relative sense; because of mutilation of Q-1 they would not be
precise, there would be some mild adjustments.</p>

<p>What I am illustrating here is a very prominent groove. In this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
case, Q-1 has displaced slightly in the mechanics of photography so that the
lower broad shoulder that you see here of this heavy line does not match up.
This should come up just slightly above.</p>

<p>The photographer in printing chose this negative rather than another one
which would have been superior, and I apologize for this particular photograph.</p>

<p>But this groove, along with the other pattern shown on 609, also appear
prominently on Q-2 and Q-3 as prominent index marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I don't quite understand 610. This is the last one we have
just admitted.</p>

<p>Are these ridges the same? This wouldn't be very clear for the record&mdash;this
is 609 that I have here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, this is not the same view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is not the same view at all. It is a different part of the
bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This is rotated, both of them rotated simultaneously the same
amount to bring those into position here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Now on 610, I don't see anything comparable on the Q-1 bullet,
a ridge comparable on the Q-1 bullet to the one I find on the K-1 bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. The dividing line is right through here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. And it is this big groove gouged through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It stops there at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It stops right here. This is the base of the bullet. The lead is
protruding, that is what you see down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Could you circle the mark you are discussing now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. That comprises the three positions of the comparison of Q-1 and
K-1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you also take photographs of Q-2, which is our Commission
number 567?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; this particular position is a comparison of Q-2 and Q-1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You took this photograph, Mr. Nicol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have this admitted as 611?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 611 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Due to the extent of mutilation of these two projectiles, I found
it more advantageous to compare Q-1 and Q-2 rather than comparing Q-2 and
K-1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In other words, you took Q-1, which you had already identified
as having been fired through&mdash;from the same rifle as K-1, and compared it
with Q-2 in the photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, in determining whether Q-2 had been fired from the
same rifle as K-1, that is, in determining whether the suspect bullet had been
fired from the same rifle as the test bullet, did you match up Q-2 against the
test bullet or against Q-1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I did both. But photographically, I could get a better illustration
between Q-1 and Q-2 rather than K-1, because what was apparent was that
the heavy groove here, which would be a projection in the barrel, and, of course,
being outstanding, would be subject to rapid wear, had changed somewhat between
the Q specimens and the K specimens. And so in order to get closer
to the actual time of the original firing, it was advantageous to make a comparison
of Q-1 and Q-2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But you arrived at a conclusion independently also on the
basis of K-1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, also on the basis of other striations which are not as easily
illustrated photographically, the reason being the mutilation of the projectile.
And here we are comparing a curved surface with a flat surface, or a curved
surface that is flattened out, and the geometry is no longer the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But you did compare Q-2 to K-1 under the microscope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And did you arrive at a positive conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, I did. It is my conclusion that the same weapon that fired
K-1 fired Q-2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So the photograph that compares Q-1 and Q-2 is only for
illustrative purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. For clarification purposes, am I correct that Q-2 is the mutilated
fractured bullet that was found in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And was Q-3 in such a situation that it furnished any useful
test or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes; I could use it for comparison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was the other part, or separate part found in the President's
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Q-2 is the nose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes, I remember that. I looked at that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. You see, what I have to work with is this flat back portion there,
as against the round part, and of course the geometry is just not the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You were pointing just now <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Q-2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Q-2 is the nose and Q-3 is the base?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Base portion, correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Of the fractured bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Or bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Or bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you had just begun to show us photograph 611.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. 611 represents, for purposes of illustration&mdash;it represents Q-1 on
the right and Q-2 on the left, and the major mark that I referred to on the
comparison of K-1 and Q-1 is represented by this deep gouge across the field
here. There are also other smaller striations that are in the match, above it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You now show me a photograph of Q-l and Q-3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take this photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It will be admitted as Commission Exhibit 612.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 612 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again I ask, Mr. Nicol, whether in arriving at your conclusion
you made a comparison of Q-3 directly against K-1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; I did. And the purpose here, as expressed before, is
that the illustration seemed to be better between Q-1 and Q-3, as far as the
photographic presentation was concerned.</p>

<p>We have here Q-1 on the right and Q-3 on the left. Just down at the base
portion of Q-1, just the small portion visible here, there is a group of very
prominent marks that are in a match relationship there. These are the same
group referred to <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is Q-1 and Q-3 that Mr. Rhyne is looking at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It would be the same area as referred to in 609.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, does that complete your photographs of the three bullets
in Exhibits 399, 567, and 569?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. That's right&mdash;against Commission Exhibit 572.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Nicol, I hand you Commission Exhibit 573 and I
ask you whether you are familiar with this item, which I state for the record
is a bullet found inside the Walker residence after the attempted assassination
of General Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; I have seen this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is your mark on that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, did you make an examination of Commission Exhibit
573 to determine whether it was fired from the same rifle as Commission
Exhibit 572, which we have&mdash;one of which we have also been calling K-1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I found that within the limits that Commission Exhibit 573 is
badly mutilated as a result of having struck some hard object on the side&mdash;that
the class characteristics generally correspond, that is to say it would be
fired from a weapon of comparable rifling to Commission Exhibit 572. Then
looking at an area which I can best describe on 609 as being a burr that develops
along the edge of the rifling, I found both on the upper surface, which
would be the groove impression, and along on the shoulder, quite a few points,
individual characteristics, which matched up in each of the positions which were
visible.</p>

<p>Because of the mutilation I was not able to put these in the kind of a match
relationship that would suggest a positive identification. However, I did not
find anything on Commission Exhibit 573 that was incompatible with Commission
Exhibit 572, so without going to the degree of saying that there is a
positive identification, I would express it this way&mdash;that there is a fair probability
that Commission Exhibit 573 was fired from the same weapon that fired
672.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Nicol, we had testimony from a Mr. Frazier yesterday
of the FBI Firearms Section, and he testified that the FBI does not
make probable identifications, but merely positive or negative identifications.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I am aware of their position. This is not, I am sure, arrived at
without careful consideration. However, to say that because one does not find
sufficient marks for identification that it is a negative, I think is going overboard
in the other direction. And for purposes of probative value, for whatever
it might be worth, in the absence of very definite negative evidence, I think it
is permissible to say that in an exhibit such as 573 there is enough on it to
say that it could have come, and even perhaps a little stronger, to say that it
probably came from this, without going so far as to say to the exclusion of all
other guns. This I could not do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span> (addressing Mr. Eisenberg). Would you refresh my memory as
to this other exhibit&mdash;I don't remember&mdash;is 573 the actual bullet that was fired
and mutilated in the Walker attempt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And 572 is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Those are the test bullets fired by the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I was a little puzzled by the order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes. That is just the order in which they were introduced in
evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And really 573 came before 572 in terms of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That clears it up for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This is the condition of the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have seen the bullet, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It is in sad shape, to say the least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. As I understand your testimony, therefore, you feel that
there are sufficient identical microscopic characteristics on 572 and 573 to say
that they were probably fired from the same weapon, but not enough to say
that they were definitely fired from the same weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes. My opinion would be based upon the finding of families of
lines that would be of the order of two to four fine striations on the burr that
I referred to. For a stronger identification, I would want a larger group, I
would want perhaps five or six in a given area, all matching in terms of
contour as well as position. But this I did not find. And so for that reason,
I would not want to express this as a positive finding. However, I would not
want to be misunderstood or suggest that this could not have come from that
particular gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you say burr. This is a burr in the barrel of the rifle
which <span class="locked">produced&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, I believe it is the result of a displacement of metal as the
land impresses into the jacket material, and actually machines up a burr along
here on the driving edge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So is there an extrusion on&mdash;on the rifle barrel which would
produce that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It may have been true at one time. It appeared at some point
in the passage through the barrel, this portion of the jacket curled up and
subsequently before it left the barrel was touched by the rifling, so that it is
now flat and even. When I refer to it as a burr, it is not raised up. It is even
with the rest of this surface. But you can see the definite outline of that burr
at the land edge.</p>

<p>(At this point the Chairman entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, would this be caused by an extrusion in the barrel or
a concavity in the barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It is probably the result of erosion back at the chamber, back
at the rear of the barrel, along the land edge here, and then as the bullet gets
to the end of the barrel, pressures decrease, so erosion also decreases, and
therefore there is still rifling enough left to press this down and make some
impression on the projectile itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And does this lie within a land impression, or the edge of
a land impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It would be actually in the groove impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. In the groove impression of the bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Of the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you found this same mark on the Walker bullet as
you found on the bullets that <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. All the Q specimens and the K specimens had this characteristic
burr. Now, I could not honestly say that this would not be found, the burr
would not be found on other weapons of similar construction, similar velocity.
However, the fine lines that you can see visible in this photograph, by which
an identification could be made, would be the same individual characteristics
as any other fine lines on the rifling impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, Mr. Nicol, was this burr in the same position in its
relation to the edge of the groove on what we have been calling the Walker
bullet as it was in the other bullets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir. And, as a matter of fact, repeated in about the same
extent in those land positions and groove positions which are still visible on
that projectile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that you not only have the existence of the burr, but
you have it at a characteristic distance from the edge of a groove impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Correct. And while the contour matched, this is not as significant,
because any two guns manufactured with the same rifling cutter, as
perhaps a production weapon like this would be, would have the same contour
characteristics. So this would not necessarily be definitive. But the presence
of those individual characteristics which are referred to, although not sufficient
for a positive, certainly would indicate that there is a possibility that
this is fired from that particular gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Were you able to secure photographs of this Walker bullet
under the microscope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No; I could not, because what I would be comparing would be
a curved surface that is flattened out with the test bullets, which would be
still in curved geometry. So that while I might get one point in match, the
others, you see, would be spread out. So that&mdash;actually, an identification of
that kind is made in a dynamic fashion. That is to say, one bullet is slid and
the other bullet is rotated. So that it is in a sense unfolding the curved bullet
so that it resembles in a progressive way the flattened out projectile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, I now hand you Commission Exhibit&mdash;well, before
I go into that, is there any further testimony you wish to give on the
subject of the rifle bullets?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No. The only other work I did on it was with respect to an
examination of the nose of Q-1 to ascertain whether there was any evidence
of ricochet or perhaps contact with fabric and so on.</p>

<p>However, although there were some fine striations on there, there was nothing
of such a nature that it would suggest a pattern, like a weave pattern or
anything of that nature. So that except for the nick, which I understand has
been explained as a site where spectrographic tests were conduced, no further
tests were run on either of those projectiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>For the record, the nick which Mr. Nicol refers to was in the nose of what
was given to you as Q-1&mdash;and which I have been informed was a bit of metal
that was taken out by the FBI to make a spectrographic test on the chemical
composition of the bullet, and therefore was not produced in the process of
firing the bullet.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Nicol, I hand you Commission Exhibits 545, 543, and 544, which
for the record consist of three shells, three rifle cartridge cases, which were
found on the sixth floor of the TSBD building at the easternmost corner of
the south face. I ask you whether you are familiar with those shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They bear your mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; there is a little JDN inscribed very lightly under the
Q position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You are familiar with these shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir. And these were given to me by you on the same day
I received the projectiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I hand you Commission Exhibit 557, which also consists
of&mdash;which consists of two expended shells, and I ask you whether you are
familiar with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir. These are the specimens, the two shells which I used
as standards or tests to compare against the other three fired cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you obtained those from what source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I obtained these from Mr. Eisenberg on the 24th of March here
in this office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again for the record, I obtained these shells from the FBI
and turned them over directly to Mr. Nicol, and they have been identified
earlier as having been fired by the FBI from Exhibit 139, the rifle found on
the sixth floor of the TSBD building.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Nicol, did you examine the shells in Exhibits 543, 544, and 545 to
determine whether they had been fired from the same rifle as fired the shells
in Exhibit 557?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And what was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Based upon the similarity of the firing-pin impressions and the
breech-block markings, as well as ejector and extractor marks, it is my opinion
that all three of the exhibits, 545, 543, and 544, were fired in the same weapon
as fired Exhibit 557.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, did you take photographs of the various shells
under the microscope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I took photographs of the specimen which I referred to, or was
referred to, as Q-48, which would be this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes. That is Commission Exhibit 545.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. These were also taken under the comparison microscope in the
same fashion as the other specimens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And these were taken by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. These were taken by me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I ask permission to introduce this as Exhibit
613.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It may be received.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 613 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you have extra copies of this photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. By use of this photograph, could you explain some of the
markings on Q-48, which is illustrated on the left-hand side and which is Commission
Exhibit 545, and K-1, which is on the right-hand side, which is the
test cartridge, which led you to the conclusion that both shells were fired from
the same rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. 545 is one of the shells found on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This was the lone one that was found, I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. L-o-n-e?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again, for the record, what Mr. Nicol is referring to is that
for some reason the shells were grouped into a group of two and a group of one
shells by the Dallas police, apparently on the basis that two shells were very
close together, and the third shell was a little further away. But they were
actually all within a quite small area. And this is just an arbitrary grouping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Now, although this compares&mdash;is a comparison of Q-48 and K-1,
Commission Exhibits 545 and 572&mdash;I'm sorry, 557&mdash;the same would apply to
comparable regions on Exhibits 543 and 544.</p>

<p>I have placed arrows just for fiduciary marks so we can be looking at the
same area.</p>

<p>Taking the top arrow, the area running across there is rather broad, an
eroded or corroded band, a valley. Below it is a fairly distinct mark. The
two small marks appear below it. And then on the projectile, at the middle
arrow, there is a broad flat plane. This plane has an irregular contour, and
what I have attempted to do is match a projection at the lower portion of
this&mdash;you also see that the contour at the top is equivalent, insofar as the
spatial area.</p>

<p>Below, there are at the lower arrow some additional marks. These begin
to come to the edge of the primer. What we are looking at here is actually
the primer of the cartridge case, and the marks are the breech-block markings
as the result of the pressure of the set-back of the shell.</p>

<p>I have a sequence of these where the division moves across. Do you want
to introduce all of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes; I think we should mark them in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. All right.</p>

<p>This would be the dividing line of the comparison bridge moved over a small
portion. You see the entire flat area here, but the match has now shifted over
slightly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I am holding two photographs, both marked Q-48 and K-1.
You took both photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder if, for clarification, we could take one of those shells
and see from what angle the photograph is taken and what is covered in the
photograph. I am a little confused. It doesn't make any difference which
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>The area shown between this dark ring would represent the area between
these two grooves right here. Actually, it is the entire primer. This is the
firing-pin impression you are looking at right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have these admitted, these last photographs,
as 614 and 615?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. 614 and 615, exhibits as described, will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photographs referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 614
and 615 and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Now, this again illustrates Q-48 and K-1 with the position now
such that the division of the field is moved over approximately a sixteenth of
an inch from the position we looked at previously. And again at the points
indicated by the arrow, there are individual characteristics running across the
dividing line of the comparison in both the top and bottom region.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, from the position of the firing-pin hole on Q-48, on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
last exhibit, it appears that it is not perfectly aligned with the position of the
firing-pin hole on K-1, Mr. Nicol. I am looking at the mark on the right-hand
side of Q-48.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes. And the purpose for the mis-alignment was in order to
show these smaller marks that appear right at the edge of the firing-pin
impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that at the top the markings on Q48 and K-1 will not
run into each other, as well as on the bottom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. If they are divergent, of course, they will not. If they are
parallel, it makes no difference where the position is.</p>

<p>Now, this is another setting, going to the opposite side of the firing-pin impression,
just translating the two cartridge cases the same distance, so that we
are now looking at a division at the other side, and a comparison of the breech-block
markings on the other side of the two shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Again marked Q-48 and K-1. You took this photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have permission to mark this 615?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It shall be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 615 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Looking at the position of the upper arrow, there is a pair of
diagonal marks, a small mark immediately below it going down to the lower
part of the breech-block markings. There are a series of parallel lines at approximately
a 45-degree angle to the division of the bridge. These were duplicated
on both&mdash;all of the cartridge cases submitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am not entirely clear in my mind what this demonstrates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This is the basis upon which I arrived at the conclusion that the
two cartridge cases, K-1 and Q-48, were fired in the same weapon. Actually,
we could take a good match, such as shown here, or even this one, and this
would be sufficient. All I have done here is repeat this by moving the two
bullets, or the two cartridge cases together the same translated distance, and
then taking a series of photographs at each particular position. So they represent
actually the same thing in each one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As the hammer comes down on the cartridge, it makes a distinctive
mark, is that the idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No. I have not compared the firing-pin impression. What this
is is the setback of the shell against the breech face, against the rear of the
chamber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The breech face makes an impression on the shell, and that is
a distinctive impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Very definitely, just as individual as a fingerprint.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. These are two further photographs that you took, Mr. Nicol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And they both illustrate the same cartridge case, the same
two cartridge cases, the one questioned and the one known?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And you have moved the hairline somewhat over to the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I introduce these as 616 and 617?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They shall be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photographs described were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 616 and
617 and were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, I suggest that in the interest of time, since
these two photographs are merely continuations of the first series, we go on to
the next.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicol, you have further photographs now. These are marked Q-48 and
K-1, and these are separate photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Same photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is submitted as 618, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It shall be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 618 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, was this photograph taken to show the same point as
the previous photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Not exactly. This shows the rim of the two cartridge cases. K-1
is just barely visible. Q-48 represents the other half of the picture. And what
we are looking at here in the match relationship, at the point of the arrow, is
a patch which represents the extractor riding around the rim of the shell at
the time that the cartridge was introduced into the chamber. I might qualify
that by saying this: in order to be certain of the exact factor which produced
this, I would have had to examine the weapon and conducted some tests to
ascertain whether this was the extractor or the bolt pushing the cartridge into
the chamber when the mechanism was operated.</p>

<p>In any case, the same tool, whether it be the extractor or the bolt, produced
this pattern of lines on both the known and the unknown cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, did you find that mark repeated on the cartridge case
in other places?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This was repeated on Q-6 and 7. However, what you may be
referring to is another series which was only found on Q-6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, could you get to that photograph you just mentioned,
Q-6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I photographed the Q-6 in three different positions, which I designated
as 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Have we identified Q-6 before on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes. Q-6, I think it is stated on the record, is the equivalent
of our Commission Exhibit 543.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is 543?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. 543 is a shell found in the TSBD building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This is a photograph I took of the head&mdash;a portion of the head
of Q-6, or Commission Exhibit 543.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have this admitted as 619, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It shall be admitted as 619.</p>

<p>(The photograph described was marked Commission Exhibit No. 619 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It might be well to introduce these, too. These are the same as
the ones which are mounted, except that I have cut them for the purpose of
matching them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I would like to introduce these two photographs&mdash;also taken
by you, Mr. Nicol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Which are similar, or taken from this photograph. That
will be 620 and 621, Mr. Reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Exhibits 620 and 621 as described will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photographs described were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 620
and 621 and were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Perhaps in order to illustrate this we ought to get all the three
in, or at least another set, so I can show the match relationship photographically&mdash;so
that this represents another position of Q-6, or 543.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And this is a photograph which has not been admitted yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this admitted as 622, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. 622 and 623.</p>

<p>(The items referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 622 and 623,
and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you just briefly describe these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This represents another position of the cartridge case, the head
of the case&mdash;you are looking at the rim, and this is the portion of the head
stamp representing millimeter. This was a 6.5 millimeter. You see just a
portion of the "5." And what I will be talking about is the marks down against
the rim in all of these exhibits.</p>

<p>Now, this is the same cartridge as represented by these other two photographs,
with a slight rotation.</p>

<p>Now, we have only one which we might have to pass around. But if the photograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
621 is placed in a position corresponding to the arrows, a match of the
fine striations, the pairs of broad lines as well as the fine lines, can be seen.</p>

<p>The reason that this could not be taken under the comparison microscope
is that because of course we cannot divide the cartridge case, so that this had
to be done photographically rather than being done on a comparison basis.</p>

<p>Now, this illustrates the fact that the same operation occurred twice on this
particular cartridge case.</p>

<p>Do you want to introduce the third at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>This is a photograph taken by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Of the same cartridge case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Same cartridge case in a different position, rotated in a different
position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. May I have permission to introduce this as 624, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photograph described was marked Commission Exhibit No. 624 and was
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. If we compare 624 and 621 in the same general fashion, again we
we have a match of the individual characteristics. So that again the same
mechanical operation occurred on this cartridge case, 543, three different times,
and in a rather random fashion. They are not the angular relationship between
each of these sets of patterns&mdash;it is not divisible by any particular number. It
is just a random occurrence.</p>

<p>Associated with this is another mark that occurs on all three of the positions,
however not in any particular relationship to the group of lines, and
perhaps not as definitive. And it was on the basis of the match of these
patterns that I would conclude that this cartridge had been introduced into a
chamber at least three times prior to its final firing. So that this would represent,
you might say, a practice or dry-run loading the gun and unloading it
for purpose of either determining its&mdash;how it functions, or whether it was in
proper function, or just for practice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Just to review this testimony, Mr. Nicol, this is a mark
which occurs on the base of the cartridge case, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And are you able to say definitely whether it is an extractor
or an ejection mark or a chambering mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It appears to me to be an extractor mark, although I was not
able to identify this as similar to any extractor mark or any other marks on
either Q-7 or 544 or any of the tests, 557.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did extractor marks appear on those other cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And when you say you were not able to identify them, do you
mean that they were not identical to <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. They were absent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. They were absent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Absent in all the other cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. So that extractor marks did not appear in the other cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Extractor marks appeared, but these marks did not appear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, two sets of extractor marks have been put <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This would be possible&mdash;perhaps the violence with which the
weapon was activated in this particular incident&mdash;or it might be the result
of something not associated with the internal mechanism of the weapon, but
might be the result of the charger or the cartridge carrier that is introduced
into&mdash;the way the cartridges are introduced into the magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, what led you to the conclusion that this was an extractor
mark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Only that it appears at the location of the cartridge case where
an extractor mark would normally be found. That is to say, this would be
the mark where the extractor strikes the edge of the case, and then springs
around as the cartridge is driven into the chamber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But you could not definitely say whether it is an extractor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
mark produced by the rifle through which the test bullets you were given
were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, sir; I could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, I am not quite clear as to why another set of marks
should have appeared on the other cases, which you also think are extractor
marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I cannot say that this could not have been produced by another gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That might have been produced by another gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But it was produced by the same source, whether it was
this gun or another gun, three different times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Somebody had done one operation, in your opinion, with
this cartridge at three different times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, just to set this in context, I have taken the bolt from
Commission Exhibit 139, the rifle found on the sixth floor, and could you show
the Commission what the extractor is on this bolt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. The extractor is this semicircular piece extending back in the
bolt, and its purpose is to withdraw the cartridge from the chamber at the
time that the bolt is drawn back. It rides in the extractor groove, which is
machined in the head of the cartridge case. At the time that the weapon is
loaded, oftentimes this springs around, it first contacts the rim of the cartridge
case, and then springs around the rim of the cartridge and produces marks
such as these, or marks such as I have illustrated on the three sets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, is it possible that the reason the marks were present
on this cartridge but not on the other cartridge case&mdash;on this cartridge case
but not on the other cartridge cases you examined&mdash;is because these marks
were produced by dry firing as opposed to actual firing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This is possible. The weight of the empty shell would be different
of course from one which had a projectile in it, so that its dynamics might be
different, and it might produce a different mark&mdash;although in the absence of
accessibility of the weapon, or the absence of these marks on the tests, I
really am unable to say what is the precise origin of those marks, except to
speculate that they are probably from the extractor, and that the second mark
that appears here, which I have indicated with a similar number, is probably
an ejector mark.</p>

<p>Now, this, I might add, is a different type of ejector mark than the mark
found on the rim from the normal firing of these tests and the evidence
cartridges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, you stated that another mark appeared in all three&mdash;associated
in juxtaposition with the three marks you have been describing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes; and in the same angular relationship to a radii through the
center of the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, again, if it is an ejector mark, might the difference
have been caused by the fact that it may have been associated with a dry
firing rather than an actual firing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. That might be possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you think a person would apply a different bolt pressure
in a dry firing as opposed to an actual firing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Well, since this is a manually operated weapon, it is quite possible
that no two operations are done with exactly the same force. However,
with reasonable reproduceability, all these marks appear to the same depth
and to the same extent, so that it would appear that whatever produced them
operated in identically the same fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Do you have anything you would like to add to your testimony
on the rifle bullets or the rifle cartridge cases, Mr. Nicol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, sir; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. If there are no further questions on that particular subject,
I will proceed to the Tippit bullets and cartridge cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I hand you, Mr. Nicol, a group of four cartridge cases marked
Commission Exhibit 594, which, for the record, are cartridge cases found in
the area of the Tippit crime scene, and ask you whether you are familiar with
those cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; these are cartridge cases which were given to me on
March 26th by Mr. Eisenberg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. They have your mark on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No; I made notes of the FBI designations, and these are the
same&mdash;they have the JH and the CK and RF and the Q designations that were
placed on there by the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Those initials are initials apparently of examining agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I presume so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I hand you Commission Exhibit 595 and ask you whether
you are familiar with the cartridge cases contained in that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes; these are two fired cartridge cases designated K-3 by the
FBI and marked with their identification marks&mdash;CK, JH, and RF.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, for the record, these cartridge cases were earlier identified
as having been fired by the FBI in Commission Exhibit No. 143, the revolver
believed to have been used to kill Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Also for the record, I obtained these cartridge cases, both Exhibit 595, which
are test cases, and Exhibit 594, which are cases from the murder scene, from the
FBI, and transmitted them directly to Mr. Nicol for his examination.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicol, did you examine the cartridge cases in Exhibit 594 to determine
whether they had been fired from the weapon in which the cartridge cases in
Exhibit 595 had been fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And can you give us your conclusions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It is my opinion, based upon the similarity of class and individual
characteristics, that the four cartridge cases in 594 were fired in the same weapon
as produced the cartridge cases in 595.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, did you take photographs of the comparisons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. However, you are certain in your own mind of the
identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes; the marks on the firing pin particularly were very definitive.
Apparently this firing pin had been subjected to some rather severe abuse, and
there were numerous small and large striations which could be matched up very
easily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What do you mean by severe abuse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It appeared as though it had either been touched up with a file,
or in the initial manufacture the finishing operation was rather crude. It was
not what I would consider a well-finished firing pin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, just to review your earlier testimony, as I recall
you stated that you do not use photographs to make your identification, and
usually do not testify with photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. But that the other photographs were made as an accommodation
to us, at my request, so that the Commission could see them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. The material I am just talking about could well have been illustrated.
However, I ran out of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, finally I hand you a group of four bullets marked
Commission Exhibits 602, 603, 604, and 605, which I state for the record were
recovered from the body of Officer Tippit, and a group of two bullets marked
Commission Exhibit 606, which I state for the record were fired by the FBI
through the revolver, Commission Exhibit 143.</p>

<p>I ask you whether you are familiar with this group of exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. These two are fired lead projectiles that were designated by the
FBI as K-3, companions to the tests in 595.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say companions, you mean they were given to
<span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. They were given to me simultaneously in an envelope, at that time
wrapped in cotton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the other Exhibits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This was the projectile designated by the FBI, I believe, as Q-13.</p>

<p>This is a .38 Special projectile designated Q-502. That would correspond to
Commission Exhibit 603.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And the item you just identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Q-13 would correspond with 602.</p>

<p>This is Q-501, corresponding to Exhibit 604.</p>

<p>This is Q-500, corresponding to Exhibit 605.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Are you familiar with all of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes; I have seen and examined all of these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you examine Exhibits 602 through 605 to determine
whether they have been fired from the same weapon as fired 606?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What was your conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Due to mutilation, I was not able to determine whether 605, 604,
and 602 were fired in the same weapon. There were similarity of class characteristics&mdash;that
is to say, there is nothing evident that would exclude the weapon.
However, due to mutilation and apparent variance between the size of the
barrel and the size of the projectile, the reproduction of individual characteristics
was not good, and therefore I was unable to arrive at a conclusion beyond
that of saying that the few lines that were found would indicate a modest possibility.
But I would not by any means say that I could be positive.</p>

<p>However, on specimen 602&mdash;I'm sorry&mdash;603, which I have designated as Q-502,
I found sufficient individual characteristics to lead me to the conclusion that
that projectile was fired in the same weapon that fired the projectiles in 606.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. That is to the exclusion of all other weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. By the way, on the cartridge cases, that was also to the
exclusion of all other weapons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Did you take a photograph of this identified missile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I took a photograph of one position, and that is shown here as a
comparison of K-3 and what I designated as Q-502.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I have this admitted? That would be
625.</p>

<p>(The item described was marked Commission Exhibit No. 625 and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. These arrows, Mr. Nicol, can you explain why they are
different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This was one I made up originally and then decided that the
illustration would be ample with one arrow in that one position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The one that is being admitted is the one-arrow photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. The arrows are placed on mechanically after the photograph
is developed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And therefore it can vary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes. This is not a part of the photographic process.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. What is the magnification here, Mr. Nicol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. It would be pretty close to 25 to 30 diameters. I cannot measure
exactly the magnification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This illustrates some of the lines, not all of them, that I saw on a
comparison of 502 and K-3. At the position of the arrow, you are looking at the
top of the groove; adjacent to it in the lower portion is a land impression. And
on that shoulder there are approximately five or six matching lines. They are
very fine striations. These would be indicative of the fact that the same portion
of the barrel had ridden on both projectiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Well, now, there seems to be significantly less markings here
than on the bullets which were seen earlier, which had come from the rifle. Does
that same condition pertain when the bullet is viewed under the microscope?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes. Of course, we are dealing with two different types of ammunition.
One is a lead projectile, and the other is a metal-case projectile.
And the ability of the metal-case projectile to pick up and retain fine striations,
even in spite of distortion and mutilation, far exceeds what the lead projectile
will do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the lead being a soft and low-melting-point material is more
subject to erosion of hot gases. So that there are many more variables in the
reproduction in terms of a lead projectile as over against a metal-case projectile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. You found enough similarities to satisfy yourself that there
is an identification here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I am satisfied that the two projectiles came from the same weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, we have received testimony that the weapon which is
marked Commission Exhibit 143 was rechambered but not rebarreled, so that a
.38 Special bullet fired through the barrel would be slightly undersized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Of course I have not had a chance to examine the weapon. But
on the information that you gave me, this was originally manufactured for
English ammunition, and has been rechambered for American domestic ammunition,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. The undersized bullet going through an oversized barrel of course
presents some serious identification problems, because it does not go through
with the same conformity as a projectile going through the proper-sized barrel,
so that it is apt to, you might say, skip and bear more on one surface than
on another in subsequent firings, so that the identification is made more complex
and it is expected that more dissimilarities occur under those circumstances.</p>

<p>However, at the points where it did reproduce at the land edges, as shown
in this photograph, I found sufficient lines of identification to lead me to the
conclusion that they had both been fired in the same weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is it consistent with the markings you found on this bullet that
it had been fired in a slightly oversized barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Slight. However, due to the malleability of lead, it does accommodate
itself more than a metal-case projectile, and therefore the evidence of
being fired in an oversized barrel is not as pronounced as it would be if it were
fired, let's say, a .32-20 fired in a .38 Special, which would be possible, and would
give very distinct evidence of the difference in the size of the bullet and the
barrel. However, in neither case is an identification completely precluded.
What is necessary is that tests are available which have borne on the same
surface. If this is true, and if the marks have not been mutilated, then an
identification is still possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. When you say the bullet will accommodate itself, you mean it
will expand to fill out all or part of the lands and grooves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Yes. Actually, with the pressure on the base and the inertia of
the bullet, it is in a sense shorter and expanded in diameter to accommodate for
the larger-sized barrel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Now, I was not clear whether you drew any conclusion on the
other three bullets&mdash;that is, did you definitely&mdash;find yourself definitely unable
to identify those bullets, or did you reach a "probable" conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I would say there was nothing, no major marks to preclude it.
However, I was unable to find what would satisfy me to say that it positively
came from that particular weapon. So that I would place it in the category
of bullets which could have come from this particular weapon, but not to the
exclusion of all others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Is this short of the "probable" category in which you placed
the Walker bullets, or is it in the same category?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. This is in a gray area between black and white, and it is somewhat
nebulous to pin it down to a precise percentage dimension.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, were you able to identify the type of bullet which
is involved in each of these four exhibits&mdash;that is, the manufacturer of 603, 602,
604, and 605?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No; I did not attempt this, because I did not have an adequate
reference collection against which to make the comparison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. I do not have any further questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I have no questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhyne</span>. No questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. Mr. Nicol, do you have anything you would like to add before
we conclude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No; I think I have covered everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We want to thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. There is one further question I have.</p>

<p>When you made your examination, were you aware of the conclusions which
any other examining agent or body had come to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No. I of course was aware of the fact that tests were conducted.
However, I was not aware either through the press or any other media as to
the conclusions. This represents my own personal conclusions without benefit
of any other knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Eisenberg</span>. And do you know at this point what any other body has
come to in the way of conclusions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder if you would be willing to give us your views as to the
effectiveness of paraffin tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I have used the paraffin test both in case work and in experiments,
as an investigative aid. However, I have a very low level of confidence in
it&mdash;either as a positive or negative, as far as that's concerned.</p>

<p>Experimentally, as the literature well demonstrates, it is possible to fire a
gun and get nothing on the hands. It is also possible to take people at random
off the street and test them with the reagent which is not specific for powder
and find all kinds of reactions. And while there are some "experts" who&mdash;and
I say that with quotes&mdash;who allege that they can differentiate one product
from another, actually the end product of the oxidation of diphenylamine is a
definite quinoid structure, which has only one blue color, and I am not sure
how they make this differentiation. I cannot do it.</p>

<p>I have used it as an investigative aid with positive results if and when I
find in the cast a particle of powder that I can definitely identify as powder&mdash;not
just simply the reaction, but something I can take out, put it under the
microscope and I can say this is a particle of powder. Then I will say that
this hand has been in the presence of the discharge of a weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You do not need a paraffin test for that, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I don't think so. I think if you actually examine the subject's
hands, you probably can find that. Although as a rule in the laboratory we
do not see the subject, and so this is the medium by which we get a look at
the surface of the hand.</p>

<p>Sometime ago in Los Angeles a series of experiments was conducted whereby&mdash;and
this was on shooting victims, including only those where they could be
certain by other investigative means as to the exact status of the case. One
of the technicians placed the paraffin on the hand. This was presented to the
other technician who had no knowledge of the case whatsoever. And that I
guess must have included both the controls of non-shooting victims as well as
shooting victims. And the net result was if this fellow almost flipped a coin
he could be in the ball park as far as whether or not this person had actually
fired a weapon.</p>

<p>It just is not particularly accurate.</p>

<p>I might go further to say that there have been several cases in which I would
say a fair amount of injustice was done to the defendant or the suspect in the
case simply because people have gone overboard on the application of the
paraffin test.</p>

<p>It is one of these areas in which everyone would like a nice test. It would
certainly be beneficial. But it is not one in which a competent technician places
much confidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I understand that pipe smokers are quite likely to get caught
on these, on these tests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Or someone who strikes a kitchen match, or in the spring, a man
fertilizing his lawn. A man working in the meatpacking industry, where they
preserve meats with nitrates, might also have difficulties. Certain of the common
things, such as urine, I think can be discounted, because the diffused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
pattern can be easily determined. But as far as pinpoints of striking a match,
I could not differentiate one from the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. I realize this doesn't help.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Nicol, thank you very much, sir, for helping us. You
have been very helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicol</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We will recess at this time until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 5:10 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>
